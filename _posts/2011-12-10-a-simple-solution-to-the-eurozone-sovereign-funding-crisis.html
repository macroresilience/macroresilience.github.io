  content: "many thanks for this post. \n\nAS you mention in your post\n\n\"The only
    argument against this plan is that such a concentrated new bank is too risky but
    that assumes that there is still default risk on Eurozone sovereign debt and that
    the commitment is not credible.\"\n\nIsn't it precisely a strong argument against
    this plan the fact that in the current context it is quite likely that Portugal
    for instance (given its public debt levels in Portugal combined with low growth
    prospects) will restructure its debt at some point?\n\nIn other words, don't you
    think that sustainability prospects in many euro area countries are so dire that
    the commitment is hardly credibe?"

    then atleast the interest rate needs to be much lower. \n\nAnd making access to
    the repo window \"open access\" will ensure that rates are hot high because of
    insolvent banks or market speculation. If rates are then high, then it will be
    purely because the market believes that the needed austerity is not politically
    doable and there is real default risk. \n\nEven if default occurs, the losses
    would not be concentrated in just a few incumbent banks."

    I agree with your reply.

    However the point I wanted to make is that simultaneous austerity accross the eu is unlikely to work in the absence of some support to aggregated demand in the line of your 'helicopter drop' proposal based on the Waldman/Mosler idea. Do you therefore consider that the 'simple solution to the eurozone sovereign funding crisis' is a second best solution under constraint of the current bad choice tu of austerity accross the board?

    best\" but simply makes the best of the situation within the parameters that we
    need to save the Euro and that fiscal union is unacceptable to the EU electorate.\n\nIMO
    the \"best\" solution involves having your own currency that can devalue in such
    circumstances. The UK economy with a 20% devaluation post the crisis is still
    struggling - if it was in the Euro, things would have been much harder. \n\nEven
    stimulus in the current environment will simply flow back to asset markets in
    the core. Just like EU easy money in 2005 triggered asset bubbles in the periphery
    when it was meant to stimulate the core, stimulus meant to help the periphery
    now will trigger asset bubbles in the core."

  content: "Francisco - the only way to make stimulus flow into the periphery is to
    institute capital controls as Steve Waldman has correctly noted. \n\nOn your example
    of SMEs, if you were an investor who got better financing terms today you'd likely
    put your money in SMEs in northern Europe. just like you would put your money
    in Spanish/Irish real estate in 2005. Same thing happened in 1998 - rate cuts
    intended to save LTCM and the banks ended up fuelling the dot com bubble. \n\nBtw,
    the ECB has also made loans to SMEs acceptable as collateral for the first time
    which is a long overdue step and something that central banks are usually very
    averse to doing for reasons I described here https://www.macroresilience.com/2011/09/12/bagehots-rule-central-bank-incentives-and-macroeconomic-resilience/"

    re/financed euro area Member States in such a way would’t the flows in the end
    go anyway ‘North’ without capital controls?\" Hopefully some of the benefit from
    lower rates on peripheral govt bonds goes on less austerity, govt job cuts etc
    in the periphery i.e. direct fiscal effects on household and corporate balance
    sheets in the periphery. Leakage would occur in fiscal actions but nowhere as
    much as in monetary actions. \n\n\"Moreover, does it mean that you do not adhere
    anymore to your ‘helicopter drop’ idea even as a purely theoretical benchmark?\"\nThe
    helicopter drop idea is really only feasible for countries where the monetary
    and fiscal authority are the same. The UK deputy governor even discussed this
    option in a speech and operationally it is very easy. But in Europe, it is not
    even legal from what I understand. If it is made legal, then it is still a worthwhile
    idea because it has a direct impact on household balance sheets in the periphery.
    Moreover, if you are an average German taxpayer wouldn't you rather sign up to
    a scheme in which the ECB prints money and sends a check for EUR 500 to each citizen
    within the Eurozone than the current scheme?"

<p>In response to the sovereign funding crisis sweeping across the Eurozone, the ECB <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2011/html/pr111208_1.en.html">decided</a> to <em>“conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) with a maturity of 36 months”</em>. Combined with the commitment of the members of the Eurozone excluding the possibility of any more haircuts on private sector holders of Euro sovereign bonds, the aim of the current exercise is clear. As Nicholas Sarkozy <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a6d2fd4e-228f-11e1-acdc-00144feabdc0.html">put it</a> rather bluntly,</p>
<blockquote><p>Italian banks will be able to borrow [from the ECB] at 1 per cent, while the Italian state is borrowing at 6–7 per cent. It doesn’t take a finance specialist to see that the Italian state will be able to ask Italian banks to finance part of the government debt at a much lower rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the ECB will not finance fiscal deficits directly but will be more than happy to do so via the Eurozone banking system. But this plan still has a few critical flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>As Sony Kapoor <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a6d2fd4e-228f-11e1-acdc-00144feabdc0.html">notes</a>, <em>“By doing this, you are strengthening the link between banks and sovereigns, which has proven so dangerous in this crisis. Even if useful in the short term, it would seriously increase the vulnerability of both banks and sovereigns to future shocks.”</em> In other words, if the promise to exclude the possibility of inflicting losses on sovereign debt-holders is broken at any point of time in the future, then sovereign default will coincide with a complete decimation of the incumbent banks in Europe.</li>
<li>European banks are desperately capital-constrained as the latest <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8de33032-21b9-11e1-8b93-00144feabdc0.html">EBA estimates</a> on the capital shortfall faced by European banks shows. In such a condition, banks will almost certainly take on increased sovereign debt exposures only at the expense of lending to the private sector and households. This can only exacerbate the recession in the Eurozone.</li>
<li>Sarkozy’s comment also hints at the deep unfairness of the current proposal. <strong>If default and haircuts are not on the table, then allowing banks to finance their sovereign debt holdings at a lower rate than the yield they earn on the sovereign bonds (at the same tenor) is simply a transfer of wealth from the Eurozone taxpayer to the banks.</strong> Such a privilege may only be extended to the banks if banking is a “perfectly competitive” sector which it is far from being even in a boom economy. In the midst of an economic crisis when so many banks are tottering, it is even further away from the ideal of perfect competition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There is a simple solution that tackles all three of the above problems - extend the generous terms of refinancing sovereign debt to the entire populace of the Eurozone such that the market for the “support of sovereign debt” is transformed into something close to perfectly competitive.</strong> In practise, this simply requires undertaking a program of fast-track banking licenses to new banks with low minimum size requirements on the condition that they restrict their activities to a narrow mandate of buying sovereign debt. This plan can correct all the flaws of the current proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of being concentrated within the incumbent failing banks, the sovereign debt exposure of the Eurozone would be spread in a diversified manner within the population. This will also help in making the “no more haircuts” commitment more time-consistent. The wider base of sovereign debt holders will reduce the possibility that the commitment will be reversed by democratic means. The only argument against this plan is that such a concentrated new bank is too risky but that assumes that there is still default risk on Eurozone sovereign debt and that the commitment is not credible.</li>
<li>The plan effectively injects new capital into the banking sector allowing incumbent bank capital to be deployed towards lending to the private sector and households. If sovereign debt spreads collapse, then the plan will also shore up the financial position of the incumbent banks thus injecting further capital available to be deployed.</li>
<li>The plan is fair. If the current crisis is indeed just a problem of high interest rates fuelling an increased risk of default, then interest rates will rapidly fall to a level much closer to the refinancing rate. To the extent that rates stay elevated and spreads do not converge, it will provide a much more accurate reflection of the real risk of default. No one will earn a supra-normal rate of return.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this blog, I have criticised the indiscriminate provision of “liquidity” backstops by central banks on many occasions. I have also asserted that key economic functions must be preserved, not the incumbent entities that provide such functions. <strong>In times of crisis, central banking interventions are only fair when they are effectively accessible to the masses.</strong> At this critical juncture, the socially just policy may also be the only option that can save the single currency project.</p>
