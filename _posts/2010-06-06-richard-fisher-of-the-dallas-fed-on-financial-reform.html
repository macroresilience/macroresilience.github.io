    shareholders, and possibly \nbondholders, will be wiped out."

  content: Ohm - On the Resolution Authority, I share Richard Fisher's skepticism
    that the exemption allowing the  paying off of system-threatening liabilities
    is too big a loophole. Even if this loophole is fixed, regulators will only be
    encouraged to use alternative bailout mechanisms even more ardently than they
    do currently in an attempt to avoid the systemic consequences of resolution.

    It's amazing - you wrote this over 9 months ago, but nothing has changed &amp; I'm not holding my breath for anything to turn around anytime in the near future either...

It also made a few  points that I felt deserved further analysis and elaboration. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Dynamics of the TBTF Problem</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In Fisher's words: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Big banks that took on high risks  and generated </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">unsustainable</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> losses received a public benefit: TBTF support. As a result,  more conservative banks were denied the market share that would have  been theirs if mismanaged big banks had been allowed to go out of  business. In essence, conservative banks faced publicly backed  competition.....It is my view that, by propping up deeply troubled big  banks, authorities have eroded market discipline in the financial  system.</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The system has become slanted not  only toward bigness but also high risk.....if the central bank and  regulators view any losses to big bank creditors as systemically  disruptive, big bank debt will effectively reign on high in the capital  structure. Big banks would love leverage even more, making regulatory  attempts to mandate lower leverage in boom times all the more  difficult.....</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is not difficult to see where  this dynamic leads—to more pronounced financial cycles and repeated  crises."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fisher  correctly notes that TBTF support damages system resilience not only by  encouraging higher leverage amongst large banks, but by disadvantaging  conservative banks that would otherwise have gained market share during  the crisis. As I have noted many times on this </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">blog</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the dynamic, evolutionary view of moral hazard  focuses not only on the protection provided to </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">destabilising</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> positive feedback forces, but on how  stabilising negative feedback forces that might have flourished in the  absence of the stabilising actions are selected against and  progressively weeded out of the system. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Regulatory Discretion and the Time  Consistency Problem</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fisher: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Language that  includes a desire to minimize moral hazard—and directs the FDIC as  receiver to consider “the potential for serious adverse  effects”—provides wiggle room to perpetuate TBTF." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fisher notes that it's difficult to  credibly commit ex-ante not to bail out TBTF creditors - as long as the  regulator retains any amount of discretion with the purpose of  maintaining systemic stability, they will be tempted to use it. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the Ineffectiveness of  Regulation Alone</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fisher: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"While it is  certainly true that ineffective regulation of systemically important  institutions—like big commercial banking companies—contributed to the  crisis, I find it highly unlikely that such institutions can be  effectively regulated, even after reform...Simple regulatory changes in  most cases represent a too-late attempt to catch up with the tricks of  the regulated—the trickiest of whom tend to be large. In the U.S.  financial system, what passed as “innovation” was in large part  circumvention, as financial engineers invented ways to get around the  rules of the road. There is little evidence that new regulations,  involving capital and liquidity rules, could ever contain the  circumvention instinct."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is a sentiment I don't often hear expressed by  a regulator - As I have opined </span></span><a href="../category/goodharts-law/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">before</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> on this </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">blog</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">regulations alone just don't work. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The history of banking is one of  repeated circumvention of regulations by banks, a process that has only  accelerated with the increased </span></span><a href="../category/complete-markets/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">completeness  of markets</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The question is not whether deregulation accelerated the  process of banks' maximising the moral hazard subsidy - it almost  certainly did and this was understood even by the Fed as early as 1983.  As John </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kareken</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> noted,</span></span> <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR721.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Deregulation  Is the Cart, Not the Horse"</span></em></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The question is whether re-regulation  has any chance of succeeding without fixing the incentives guiding the  actors in the system - it does not. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bailouts Come in Many Shapes and  Sizes</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fisher: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Even if an  effective resolution regime can be written down, chances are it might  not be used. There are myriad ways for regulators to forbear. Accounting  forbearance, for example, could artificially boost regulatory capital  levels at troubled big banks. Special liquidity facilities could provide  funding relief. In this and similar manners, crisis-related events that  might trigger the need for resolution could be avoided, making  resolution a moot issue." </span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A watertight resolution regime may only encourage  regulators to aggressively utilise other forbearance mechanisms. Fisher  mentions accounting and liquidity relief but fails to mention the most  important "alternative bailout mechanism" - the "</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Greenspan</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Put" variant of monetary policy. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Preventing Systemic Risk  perpetuates the Too-Big-To-Fail Problem</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fisher:</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "Consider the idea of limiting any  and all financial support strictly to the system as a whole, thus  preventing any one firm from receiving individual assistance....If  authorities wanted to support a big bank in trouble, they would need  only institute a </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">systemwide</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> program. Big banks could then avail themselves of the program,  even if nobody else needed it. </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Systemwide</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> programs are unfortunately a perfect back door  through which to channel big bank bailouts."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"System-wide" programs by definition  get activated only when big banks and non-banking financial institutions  such as GE Capital are in trouble. Apart from perpetuating TBTF, they  encourage smaller banks to mimic big banks and take on similar tail risk  thus reducing system diversity. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shrink the TBTF Banks?</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fisher clearly prefers that the big  banks be shrunk as a "second-best" solution to the incentive problems  that both regulators and banks face in our current system. Although I'm  not convinced that shrinking the banks is a sufficient response, even a  "free market" solution to the crisis will almost certainly imply a more  dispersed banking sector, due to the removal of the TBTF subsidy.  The gist of the problem is not size but insufficient diversity. Fisher  argues </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"there is  considerable diversity in strategy and performance among banks that are  not TBTF." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This  is the strongest and possibly even the only valid argument for breaking  up the big banks. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My concern is that even a more dispersed banking sector will  evolve towards a tightly coupled and homogenous outcome due to the  protection against systemic risk provided by the "alternative bailout  mechanisms", particularly the </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Greenspan</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Put. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The  fact that Richard Fisher's comments echo themes popular with both  left-wing and right-wing commentators is not a coincidence. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the </span></strong></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">fitness landscape</span></strong></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of our financial system, our current choice is not so much a local peak as a deep valley - tinkering  will get us nowhere and a significant move either to the left or to the  right is likely to be an improvement.</span></strong></span></p>
