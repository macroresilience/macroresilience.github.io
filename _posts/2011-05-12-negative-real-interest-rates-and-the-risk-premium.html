  content: vk - hard to say definitively but residential real estate for many is more
    than an investment which should mean less risk. But in places where its being
    bought just as an investment property, it's probably quite similar to equities.

  content: Pushing real rates negative in a sense introduces risk to the previously
    risk free asset (the loss of purchasing power). It pushes investors to purchase
    other risk assets until the spread between their expected future returns and the
    expected future return of the previously risk free asset is restored. I wouldn't
    say there is no risk premium. If the expected future return of stocks was say
    6% when the expected future return of the risk free asset was 1% and subsequent
    Fed action reduces the expected future return of the risk free asset to -3%, one
    should expect stocks to rise until their future expected return is reduced to
    2%. Shouldn't the spread be relatively stable?

  content: "Joe - in my opinion (and it's only my opinion), the price of stocks in
    your example would rise to a level that would make its future expected return
    closer to -3% than 2%. To me, the biggest component of the risk premium is the
    difference between a risk-free and a risky asset. When there is no risk-free asset
    to talk of, risk premiums collapse. To put it in behavioural terms, investors
    will accept a lower return for certainty, but they will not accept too much lower
    a return for a less uncertain payoff. When real rates are negative, different
    assets only differ in their relative uncertainty. \n\nJust to give you an idea
    of my thought process, I'm drawing on the behaviour of investors and common people
    in developing markets like India and China where negative real rates are common.
    The typical response is to invest most of one's savings in real assets - real
    estate if one is \"conservative\" and equities etc if one is more adventurous."

  content: Yes, I understand what you're saying and you did note that the risk premium
    probably isn't zero. On the other hand, US investors don't seem to understand
    real interest rates and they sure don't understand inflation. I know a lot of
    investors who are hanging onto their "risk free" assets for dear life. I live
    in Miami and interact a lot with Latin Americans. They understand exactly what
    inflation is and the effects. I guess Americans will figure it out eventually.

  content: a theoretical construct of no practical value. :) paradox of equities now
    is that they are priced with a zero risk premium, and yet for that very reason
    are much more "risky" (defined as probability of long-term capital loss) than
    they were, say, in 1981 or 1992. the Greenspan/Bernanke era has been a fantasia
    for asset prices &amp; valuation; a complete disconnect from the rest of the history
    of asset-class behavior. and this exact moment is the weirdest yet.

    and in fact, the repricing risk is distinctly non-linear. \n\nContrast this opinion
    with Bernanke's opinion in the 2003 speech linked above: \"easier monetary policy
    not only allows consumers to enjoy a capital gain in their stock portfolios today,
    but it also reduces the effective amount of economic and financial risk they must
    face.\" He sees the reduction in risk premium and concludes that risk in investing
    in stocks reduces when monetary policy is easy! Incredible."

  content: "This site has very interesting posts. Unusually, I find myself drawn into
    thought by the author's writings but in quite heated opposition to some of the
    quotes referenced.\n\nFor example, Ben Bernanke's quote above: \"The most powerful
    effect of an unanticipated monetary tightening is to increase the perceived risk
    premium on stocks, either by increasing the riskiness of stocks, by reducing people’s
    willingness to bear risk, or both. Reduced willingness of investors to hold relatively
    more risky stocks drives down stock prices.” \n\nSomeone like Ben Bernanke is
    devoted to understanding. As best as he can, he is a follower of the truth, and
    so the above quote can only be construed as a deliberate lie. \n\nBernanke knows
    that \"perceived risk\" and \"willingness\" are not effects, not in epistemically
    sound sense. Perceived risk, and willingness, can only be infered on the basis
    of purchases and sales, and are therefore secondary to actual facts, not the cause
    of them.\n\nIt evangelises the position that is really centric to the US model,
    that of freedom and choices made by autonomous agents. In a way, it is cynical
    and quite demeaning. To those who can see that the unscientific nature of such
    comments, they only serve to exaggerate the ideological nature of monetary policy
    in the USA: it doesn't matter what happens, so long as you feel you are the one
    responsible for your actions and choices."

  content: "There is plenty of evidence that sustained negative real rates increase
    equity risk premiums.  This could be for a number of reasons.  First, the \"catastrophe\"
    risk attached to an increase in real rates rises the longer an economy is addicted
    to negative real rates.  Thus, the more QE, the higher the discount rate attached
    to l.t. corporate earnings.  Second, high and variable inflation inevitably results
    from sustained negative real rates.  Under high and variable inflation, l.t. corporate
    margins are virtually impossible to forecast: investment suffers, and real revenue
    growth stagnates.  Third, governments inevitably intervene to dampen the adverse
    political effects of price distortions.  The resulting price controls and complex
    taxation regimes are another weight on equity valuations.  \n\nThe real question
    is why most observers accept the view that equities should benefit from sustained
    negative real rates. The case where they do is limited to the early-in-the-recovery
    experience of rising profit margins and low inflation; however, this is not a
    sustainable source of profit growth (as input inflation inevitably claws back
    economic rents)."

    ignored given the perceived commitment from the central bank that they will step
    in if any such thing happens. Obviously this cycle does not end well but the combination

    maintain this commitment for a lot longer. \n\nInflation is suppressed and profit
    margins are maintained by the slack in the labour market which is a consequence
    of our crony capitalist system. If the extent of real rate suppression is limited,

  content: "Ashwin,\n\nI disagree with the, \"this can go on for a long time\" comment.
    \ The implication of flat wage growth is misunderstood.  Yes, it restrains inflation;
    but it also puts the consumer between a rock (flat wages) and a hard place (rising
    commodity/import prices).  Every time the Fed takes the consumer to this place,
    demand suffers and inflation expectations crash -- we are experiencing this now.
    \ Without nominal wage growth, stimulus will not work.  With it, we will have
    high and variable inflation.  Either way, not a good situation for equities.\n\nIn
    the long term, equities are a bet on organic real growth, and gold is a bet on
    stimulus-dependent nominal growth. (A caveat: at single-digit P/E's, stocks should
    at least keep pace with inflation.)  \n\nBTW, Brazil had plenty of crony capitalism,
    and large companies there earned robust rents primarily through financial speculation.
    \ Unfortunately, this did not help P/E's much."

    by raising public salaries and subsidizing staple foods.  In other words, both
    wage inflation and high deficits were required for monetary stimulus to produce
    nominal growth.

  content: "David - again some excellent comments. \n\nYou're saying that real rate
    suppression without wage growth is unsustainable i.e. we end up in the Japan scenario
    where real rates turn positive despite the central bank's efforts. I agree with
    this! My point was just that running this policy for a long time without risking
    demonetisation or high/variable inflation is possible. If I'm a saver and am losing
    2% per annum by holding cash, it's not clear that there's any savings alternative
    out there that can help me avoid this \"tax\". That was the point I was trying
    to make in my previous post https://www.macroresilience.com/2011/05/10/monetary-policy-and-financial-markets-a-real-rates-lens/
    . \n\nThe only way to avoid the Japan scenario here is either increased leverage
    or increased fiscal deficits both of which are not an option right now. \n\nOn
    your comment on Brazil, my contention is that we have a peculiar Anglo-Saxon \"efficient\"
    variant on cronyism which is different from the crony socialism of countries like
    Brazil and India pre-liberalisation https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/12/15/the-different-shades-of-crony-capitalism/

  content: "Ashwin,\n\nLatin Americans made a science of avoiding the negative real
    rate \"tax\".  It is certainly possible for this psychology/capability to take
    hold here.  I would argue that the dollar deval and commodity price run-up is
    evidence of that.  Each time we begin to get this \"tax avoidance\" psychology,
    the Fed backs off stimulus.  Each time they back off, we face deflation.  This
    is not a stable corridor, but an unstable transition between two equilibria (deflation/inflation).
    \ My contention is that each round of stimulus produces a narrower \"real recovery\"
    duration between the two poles.  The first stimulus lasted roughly from 2003 to
    2007, the second one, IMO, lasted from 2q09 to 4q10.  The third one (following
    QE3) is likely to have a much shorter effect on real growth. In the end, the Fed
    will have to choose between the piercing the upper or lower bounds of the too-narrow
    corridor.  \n\nOne does not need more private leverage or higher fiscal spending
    to create wage inflation.  Just (implicitly) promise to monetize already-high
    projected deficits, and the rest will follow. This will probably happen in Greece
    as they re-adopt the Drachma."

  content: "David - we agree that the more the psychology takes hold, the less effective
    this monetary policy will be. \n\nI agree with you on the narrowing corridor -
    I made an analogy a while ago that the effect will be like a shower that is either
    too hot or too cold. Which is kind of the oblique message that I was making in
    my river flood management post. Ultimately the commitment of constant inflation
    becomes untenable. \n\nMy only addition would be that the forces have been building
    up for a long time. Build up of corporate surplus and lack of exploratory investment
    due to increased incumbent corporate power meant that growth and full employment
    could only be maintained with increased consumer leverage, increased govt spending
    and so on. Now we're close to exhausting all the bullets."

    "I’d argue that the risk premium is zero right now. the prospective 7-year real returns of all traditional financial asset classes is zero, and there is no incremental reward for taking on additional risk. this is a massive market distortion with unpredictable consequences."

    Its not a massive market distortion. Markets exist to equalise yields subject to perceived differentials in risk premia.

    The way they do this when risk free assets earn an unwarranted postive nominal return is to bid up the price of other assets so risk adjusted yield equalises. The flip side of this is to increase debt until it reaches a maximum, at which point risk free yields hit zero and like ashwin says risk premia converge amongst other assets.

    The biggest single distortion in play here is risk free assets that generate a risk free real return. One cannot 'declare a yield by fiat' (essentially a yield on fictional assets represented only by numbers in a central bank computer) and expect that to be stable situation.

    What I am saying is, that peak debt is the only stable equilibrium for a fiat money economy, and that there is no other choice apart from a fiat money economy, or at least an economy based on other electronic media of exchange. Because nothing real can be sent down a wire, which a pre-requisite of a modern medium of exchange.

<p>In my <a href="/2011/05/10/monetary-policy-and-financial-markets-a-real-rates-lens/">post</a> on monetary policy and real rates, I made a provocative assertion: “<strong>in the absence of a truly risk-free asset that preserves purchasing power, the very idea of a “risk premium” is meaningless.</strong> In the language of Kahneman and Tversky, it is the category boundary between certainty and uncertainty that matters most to an investor.” The idea that monetary policy has an impact on asset prices is not controversial. In a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20031002/default.htm">speech</a> in 2003, Ben Bernanke concluded that easy money policies increase asset prices primarily via a reduction in risk premiums: “The most powerful effect of an unanticipated monetary tightening is to increase the perceived risk premium on stocks, either by increasing the riskiness of stocks, by reducing people’s willingness to bear risk, or both. Reduced willingness of investors to hold relatively more risky stocks drives down stock prices.” In the same speech, Bernanke concludes that the changes in the expected evolution of real rates from changes in the Fed Funds rate are minimal. This conclusion does not hold for programs such as QE2 which directly drive down the level of the real rate curve.</p>
<p>My conjecture is simply the following: <strong>As the real rate curve turns negative, there is a non-linear transition in the risk premium for all “risky” assets towards a level close to zero</strong> (see below for an idealised chart). Risk premiums may never be exactly zero -  even under the most dovish monetary regime, the market expects real rates to turn positive at some time in the future. But the effective risk premium in a market that expects negative real rates for above <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield">5 years</a> may not be very far above zero. A great example of such a regime is a developing market like India which has experienced long and frequent periods of negative real rates (see below for current real rates across emerging markets). A consequence of such a pronounced negative real rates regime is that almost no one in India regards short-term bank deposits as a “risk free” asset. Of course this means that <strong>a move back from negative real rates territory towards positive real rates will likely have violent negative consequences for risky asset prices</strong> - a fate that Indian equity prices (see below) may be experiencing right now in the wake of the Reserve bank of India's unexpected <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/05/03/idINIndia-56737820110503">acceleration</a> of the tightening cycle.</p>
