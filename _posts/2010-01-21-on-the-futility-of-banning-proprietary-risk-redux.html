Quoting from the interview:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">SPIEGEL:</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> Banking should become boring again?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Volcker</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">:</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> Banking will never be boring. Banking is a risky business. They are going to have plenty of activity. They can do underwriting. They can do securitization. They can do a lot of lending. They can do merger and acquisition advice. They can do investment management. These are all client activities. What I don't want them doing is piling on top of that risky capital market business. That also leads to conflicts of interest."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">This is a more nuanced version of the argument that calls for the  reinstatement of the Glass-</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Steagall</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> Act. But it suffers from two fatal flaws:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Regulatory Arbitrage</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">: Separation of "client risk" and "proprietary risk" sounds good in theory but it's almost impossible to enforce in practise. As I've discussed </span><a href="../2009/12/05/regulatory-arbitrage-and-the-efficiency-resilience-tradeoff/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">previously</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">, a detailed and fine-tuned regulatory policy will  be easy to arbitrage and a blunt policy will result in a grossly inefficient financial system. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Losses on "Client Activities" were the major driver in the current crisis.</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span><a href="../2009/11/06/a-rational-explanation-of-the-financial-crisis/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">My analysis</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> of the </span><a href="http://www.ubs.com/1/ShowMedia/investors/releases?contentId=140331&amp;name=080418ShareholderReport.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">UBS shareholder report</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> highlighted how the accumulation of super-senior CDO tranches was justified primarily by their perceived importance in facilitating the sale of fee-generating junior tranches to clients. Quoting from the report: "</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">within the CDO desk, the ability to retain these tranches was seen as a part of the overall CDO business, providing assistance to the structuring business more generally."</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> It is the losses on these tranches issued in the name of facilitating client business that were at the core of the crisis. It is these tranches that caused the majority of the losses on banks' balance sheets. It is losses on insuring these tranches that brought down AIG. Segregated proprietary risk is monitored closely by almost all banks. The real villain of the piece was proprietary risk taken on under the cover of facilitating client business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Implementation of the Ban</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Clearly a simple ban on internal hedge funds and proprietary trading desks would not work. All banks trade the same product on their client's behalf that they do on a proprietary basis and such a ban can be nullified simply by folding all proprietary operations into trading desks that also facilitate client business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Another alternative would be to enforce market risk limits on banks, based on </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> for example. If </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> was the criteria in enforcing risk limits on banks in the previous crisis, the crisis would not have been averted. The super-senior CDO tranches at the heart of the crisis were low </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> assets on their own and "zero </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">" assets when merely delta hedged without any hedging of higher-order risks. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Again quoting from the UBS report: </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">“MRC </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> methodologies relied on the AAA rating of the Super Senior positions. The AAA rating determined the relevant product-type time series to be used in calculating </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">. In turn, the product-type time series determined the volatility sensitivities to be applied to Super Senior positions. Until Q3 2007, the 5-year time series had demonstrated very low levels of volatility sensitivities. As a consequence, even </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">unhedged</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> Super Senior positions contributed little to </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> utilisation.” “Once hedged, either through </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">NegBasis</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> or AMPS trades, the Super Senior positions were </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> and Stress Testing neutral (i.e., because they were treated as fully hedged, the Super Senior positions were netted to zero and therefore did not utilize </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> and Stress limits). The CDO desk considered a Super Senior hedged with 2% or more of AMPS protection to be fully hedged. In several MRC reports, the long and short positions were netted, and the inventory of Super Seniors was not shown, or was unclear. For AMPS trades, the zero </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">VaR</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> assumption subsequently proved to be incorrect as only a portion of the exposure was hedged as described in section 4.2.3, although it was believed at the time that such protection was sufficient.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">To summarise, it is extremely unlikely that there exists a way to ban proprietary risk-taking that cannot be circumvented by the banks. </span></p>
