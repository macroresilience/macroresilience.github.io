  content: "Hayek was right at that time, and is still largely right today. However,
    we're getting better at making specific predictions about the behavior of complex
    adaptive systems with techniques like machine learning. If progress continues,
    I think this idea will be less relevant.\n\nSomeone might object to this that
    new predictive technology will be applied by the market and so the market will
    remain just as difficult to predict. While this is a legitimate possibility, to
    insist that it will certainly happen would be to oversimplify the nature of the
    economy's complexity.\n\nNew predictive technology will not necessarily be equally
    accessible to everyone. Even if it is, this does not imply a return to square
    one, as various sectors will be impacted in different ways and to different extents
    by such innovations. \n\nWhile I agree with the intuition that new predictive
    technologies will have difficulty predicting their own influence on the economy,
    the intuition is nonetheless crude. New technologies might not predict all the
    consequences of their use accurately, but we should not deny the possibility they'll
    be capable of predicting some such consequences to at least an approximate degree."

    Continued (I wish you had an edit button):

    Recursive predictions are possibly going to be the most difficult-to-solve problems in macroeconomics. But if there's anything that going to be able to deal with such problems effectively, it seems like it will be a predictive computer program, as handling recursion is one of programming's greatest strengths.

    This will not happen automatically nor is it a certainty. But the possibility, at least, seems undeniable, and in my eyes the probability as well is high enough that this is worth talking about, given that the consequences would be unprecedented and huge.

    Continued again:

    You mention ecology as an example of a complex adaptive system where making predictions is nearly impossible, and I agree. However, ecologists have made strides in making predictions about environments and the effects that some interventions might have. Epidemiologists can tackle issues of disease spread under the conditions of several variables and various scenarios quite well now. And climatologists are working very hard on predicting the precise consequences that will result from greenhouse gas emissions and the feedback loops of warming on local and global systems.

    These fields are not perfect. But they are interesting and making progress, and so they're worth learning from.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">In such phenomena, according to </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Hayek</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">only pattern predictions are possible about the social structure as a whole</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">: As </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Hayek</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> explained in an </span><a href="http://hayekcenter.org/?p=882"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">interview with Leo </span></a><a href="http://hayekcenter.org/?p=882"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">Rosten</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> "We can build up beautiful theories which would explain everything, if we could fit into the blanks of the formulae the specific information; but we never have all the specific information. Therefore, all we can explain is what I like to call “pattern prediction.” You can predict what sort of pattern will form itself, but the specific manifestation of it depends on the number of specific data, which you can never completely ascertain. Therefore, in that intermediate field — intermediate between the fields where you can ascertain all the data and the fields where you can substitute probabilities for the data–you are very limited in your predictive capacities."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"Our capacity of prediction in a scientific sense is very seriously limited. We must put up with this. We can only understand the principle on which things operate, but these explanations of the principle, as I sometimes call them, do not enable us to make specific predictions on what will happen tomorrow."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Hayek</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> was adamant however that theories of pattern prediction were useful and scientific and had "empirical significance". The example he drew upon was the Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection, which provided only predictions as to the patterns one could observe over evolutionary time at levels of analysis above the individual entity. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Hayek's</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> intention with his theory was to debunk the utility of statistics and econometrics in the forecast of macroeconomic outcomes (See his </span><a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/hayek-lecture.html"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">Nobel lecture</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">). The current neoclassical </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">defense</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> against their inability to predict the crisis takes the other extreme position i.e. our theories are right because no one could predict the crisis. This contention explicitly denies the possibility of "pattern predictions" and is not a valid </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">defense</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">. Any macroeconomic theory should be capable of explaining the patterns of our economic system - no more, no less. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">One of the key reasons why timing and exact prediction is so difficult is the futility of conventional cause-effect thinking in complex adaptive systems. As Michael </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Mauboussin</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span><a href="http://www.e-m-h.org/Maub02.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">observed</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">, " Cause and effect thinking is futile, if not dangerous". The underlying causes may be far removed from the effect, both in time and in space and the proximate cause may only be the "straw that broke the camel's back". </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Many excellent examples of "pattern prediction" can be seen in ecology. For example, the proximate cause of the catastrophic degradation of Jamaica's coral reefs since the 1980s was the mass mortality of the dominant species of urchin (</span><a href="https://www.esm.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/260/Readings/Hughes_1994.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">reference</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">).  However, the real reason was the progressive loss of diversity due to overfishing since the 1950s. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">As CS Holling observed in his </span><a href="http://www.ivwl.uni-kassel.de/beckenbach/PDFs/aee0910/Holling_ResilStabilEcolSys.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> of a similar collapse in fisheries in the Great Lakes:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"Whatever the specific causes, it is clear that the precondition for the collapse was set by the harvesting of fish, even though during a long period there were no obvious signs of problems. The fishing activity, however, progressively reduced the resilience of the system so that when the inevitable unexpected event occurred, the populations collapsed. If it had not been the lamprey, it would have been something else: a change in climate as part of the normal pattern of fluctuation, a change in the chemical or physical environment, or a change in competitors or predators."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">The financial crisis of 2008-2009 can be analysed as the inevitable result of a progressive loss of system resilience. Whether the underlying cause was a buildup of debt, moral hazard or monetary policy errors is a different debate and can only be analysed by looking at the empirical evidence. However, just as is the case in ecology, the inability to predict the time of collapse or even the proximate cause of collapse does not equate to an inability to explain macroeconomic patterns. </span></p>
