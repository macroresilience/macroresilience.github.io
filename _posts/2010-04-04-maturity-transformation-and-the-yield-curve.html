    Very fine post - and an unusually informed one compared to the blogosphere standard for this subject as it pertains to actual banking operations.

    I’ll add that the most important decision facing a commercial bank ALCO on interest rate risk policy is the determination of a “benchmark” for the duration of common equity. This becomes an assumed “hedging” profile around which other hedging or positioning is partially determined. The same holds for the treatment of certain other non maturity items of indeterminate duration (e.g. the book value of real estate).

    Thus, assumptions become a major partial determinate of the consolidated risk position. Different banks use different assumptions.

    Moreover, banks distinguish between net interest margin risk and economic value risk. These risks work in opposite directions. A bank that shows a net profile of long duration assets against equity has low margin and high value risk. A bank that shows short duration assets against equity has the opposite risk profile.

    Commercial banks have risk limits that cover both types of exposure and recognize the trade-off between the two.

    Your themes of active management and generally conservative positioning are accurate as well. Moreover, it is quite possible for customer profiles to deliver positions to banks that result in short duration assets and long duration liabilities – e.g. a customer expectation of falling rates. Given the general interest rate environment, this has been a cyclical and secular factor since 1990. It has been easy for some poorly managed banks to get caught fighting the last war at various times over this full period.

    Nevertheless, the FDIC’s interest rate advisory note was most prudent at this juncture.

    Also, the typical blogosphere presentation of maturity transformation fails to distinguish between liquidity transformation and interest rate risk transformation. These are two intersecting but different profiles.

    And more might be said about the distinction regarding liquidity maturity transformation as between commercial banks and investment banks. Bear Stearns definitely had a problem with liquidity maturity transformation. That said, you make a very interest point about credit spread mismatches.

    And your point about pension/insurer demand for long duration is spot on.

  content: "JKH - Thanks for the added detail on bank ALM. The intention of my post
    was to challenge the notion that banks are lemmings at the mercy of the markets
    and the central bank. This may have been true 50 years ago but it's not even close
    to being true now. Even before a liquid interest rate derivatives market came
    into existence, ALM was an active function that aimed at mitigating the market
    risk exposure of a bank. \n\nOn your point of customer profiles delivering the
    inverse position to a bank, the Banc One case I refer to above is an example of
    that - their assets were primarily floating-rate loans and their liabilities were
    longer-term CP or deposits with \"sticky\" interest rates. In fact, they use derivatives
    to flip this exposure because their stockholders expect their balance sheet to
    be \"liability sensitive\". This is similar to why mining companies don't hedge
    their commodity price exposure because their stockholders invest in the firm as
    a synthetic long commodity play.\n\nThis brings me to another point which I've
    hinted at in the post - the conventional story of MT being essential because borrowers
    prefer long-term fixed and lenders prefer short-term floating is too simplistic.
    Most corporates have significant floating-rate liabilities - it is in fact the
    investors who prefer fixed-rate issuances which the corporate swaps into floating.
    This rush to swap into floating is partially responsible for swap spreads being
    negative in the long end (demand to receive fixed and pay floating on swap results
    in swap rates going down). And the increased presence of pension funds/life insurers
    means that there is significant demand for long duration. \n\nAs you mention,
    a lot of the confusion comes from conflating the liquidity profile with the interest
    rate risk profile."

    I do not think that the Austrian view of bank operations is an accurate one. The Austrian view is that banks take short term deposits, and then lend those out as long term loans (the evil "maturity mismatch" they always whine about).

    In practise, banks make loans, which then create the deposits. They are expanding both sides of their balance sheet, and it is not "maturity mismatching" at all in austrian sense. I do not think austrians even know what a balance sheet is.

    It is true of course that a bank manages its net maturity position as it may prefer to be long reserves more of time and reduce chance it needs to borrow at interbank market, but again, this has nothing to do with austrian view or their concpetion of banking system (which is simply wrong)

    We need an update on this.

    Still think the interest rate risk is gone? Also, don't the regional banks without interest rate swaps in place matter? I understand they're not a large fraction of all transactions in terms of value, but consumers might not care.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Maturity  Transformation (MT) enables all firms, not just banks to borrow  short-term money to invest in long-term projects. Of course, banks are  the most effective maturity transformers, enabled by deposit  insurance/TBTF protection which discourages their creditors from  demanding their money back all at the same time and a liquidity backstop  from a fiat currency-issuing central bank if panic sets in despite the  guarantee. Given the above definition, it is obvious that the presence  of MT results in a flatter yield curve than would be the case otherwise (</span></span><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mencius</span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></a><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moldbug</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> explains it well and this insight is  implicit as well in Austrian Business Cycle Theory). This post tries to  delineate the exact mechanisms via which the yield curve flattens and  how the impact of MT has evolved over the last half-century,  particularly due to changes in banks' asset-liability management (ALM)  practices. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let's  take a simple example of a bank that funds via demand deposits and  lends these funds out in the form of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. This  loan if left </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">unhedged</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> exposes the bank to three risks: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Liquidity Risk, Interest Rate Risk  and Credit Risk. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The liquidity risk is of course essentially unhedgeable - it  can and is mitigated by for example, converting the mortgage into a </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">securitised</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> form that can be sold onto other  banks. But the gap inherent in borrowing short and lending long is  unhedgeable. The credit risk of the loan can be hedged but often is not,  as compensation for taking on credit risk is one of the fundamental  functions of a bank. However, the interest rate risk can be and often is  hedged out in the interest rate swaps market. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Interest Rate Risk Management in  Bank ALM</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Prior  to the advent of interest rate derivatives as hedging tools, banks had  limited avenues to hedge out interest rate risk. As a result, most banks  suffered significant losses whenever interest rates rose. For example,  after World War II, US banks were predominantly invested in fixed rate  government bonds they had bought during the war. Martin Mayer's  excellent book on </span></span><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o_HZtpbcF4kC&amp;dq=martin+mayer+fed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9JFyoSEpyG&amp;sig=ldw-BdhBOIEG7CcmjN_RWCR4msg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5KW3S7P0G6D40wTtzNwv&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">'The Fed'</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> documents a Chase banker who said to  him in reaction to a Fed rate hike in 1952 that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"he never thought he would live to  see the day when the government would deliberately make the banking  system technically insolvent." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The situation had not changed much even by the 1980s - the  initial trigger that set off the S&amp;L crisis was the dramatic  rise in interest rates in 1981 that rendered the industry insolvent. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By the 1990s however, many banks had  started hedging their duration gap with the aim of mitigating the damage  that a sudden move in interest rates could do to their balance sheets.  One of the earlier examples is the case of </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Banc</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> One and the </span></span><a href="http://sy.zlgc.org/Upload/20070918161219718.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">HBS case study</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> on the bank's ALM strategy is a great  introduction to the essence of interest rate hedging. More recently,  the Net Interest Income (NII) sensitivity of Bank of America according  to slide 35 in this </span></span><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzY1Mjg0fENoaWxkSUQ9MzU5ODE3fFR5cGU9MQ==&amp;t=1"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">investor  presentation</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> is exactly the opposite of the typical maturity-transforming </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">unhedged</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> bank - the bank makes money when rates  go up or when the curve steepens. But more importantly, the sensitivity  is negligible compared to the size of the bank which suggests a largely  duration-matched position. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/Bank-Of-America-NII-Sensitivity.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317" title="Bank Of America NII  Sensitivity" src="/images/Bank-Of-America-NII-Sensitivity-300x278.gif" alt="" width="300" height="278" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the above analysis, I am not suggesting that the banking  system does not play the interest carry trade at all. The </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">FDIC's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> decision to release an </span></span><a href="http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2010/pr1002.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">interest rate  risk advisory</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in January certainly suggests that some banks are. I am only  suggesting that if a bank does play the carry trade, it is because it  chooses to do so and not because it is forced to do so by the nature of  its asset-liability profile. Moreover, the indications are that many of  the larger banks are reasonably insensitive to changes in interest rates  and currently choose not to play the carry game ( See also Wells  Fargo's </span></span><a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/wells-fargo-on-interest-rate-risk.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">interest rate  neutral stance</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> ). </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What  does this mean for the impact of MT on the yield curve? It means that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the role of the interest rate carry  trade inherent in MT in flattening the yield curve is an indeterminate  one. At the very least, it has a much smaller role than one would suspect. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Taking the earlier example of the bank invested in a 30-year  fixed rate mortgage, the bank would simply enter into a 30-year interest  rate swap where it pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate to  hedge away its interest rate risk. There are many possible </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">counterparties</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> who want to receive fixed rates in  long durations - two obvious examples are </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">corporates</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> who want to hedge their fixed rate  issuance back into floating and pension funds and life insurers who need to  invest in long-tenor instruments to match their liabilities. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So if interest rate  carry is not the source of the curve flattening caused by MT, what is?  The answer lies in the other </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">unhedged</span></span></strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> risk - credit risk. </strong>Credit risk curves are also usually upward sloping  (except when the credit is distressed) and banks take advantage by  funding themselves at a very short tenor where credit spreads are low  and lending at long tenors where spreads are much higher. This strategy  of course exposes them to the risk of credit risk repricing on their  liabilities and this was exactly the problem that banks and corporate  maturity transformers such as GE faced during the crisis. Credit was  still available but the spreads had widened so much that refinancing at  those spreads alone would cause insolvency. This is not dissimilar to  the problem that Greece faces at present. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The real benefit of the central bank's  liquidity backstop is realised in this situation. When interbank repo  markets and commercial paper markets lock up as they did during the  crisis, banks and influential </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">corporates</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> like GE can always repo their assets with the central bank on terms not  available to any other private player. The </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ECB's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 12-month repo program is probably the best example  of such a quasi-fiscal liquidity backstop. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Conclusion</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Given my view that the interest rate  carry trade is a limited phenomenon, I do not believe that the sudden  removal of MT will produce a</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "smoking heap of rubble" (</span></em></span><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mencius</span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></a><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moldbug's</span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> view</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">). The yield curve will steepen to the  extent that the credit carry trade vanishes but even this will be  limited by increased demand from long-term investors, most notably  pension funds. The conventional story that MT is the only way to fund  long-term projects ignores the increasing importance of pension funds  and life insurers who have natural long-tenor liabilities that need to  be matched against long-tenor assets. </span></span></p>
