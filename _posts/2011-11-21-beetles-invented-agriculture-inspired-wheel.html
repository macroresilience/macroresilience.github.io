<p>From <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/99/24/15247.full">Mueller and Gerardo</a></p>
<blockquote><p>About 40–60 million years before the advent of human agriculture, three insect lineages, termites, ants, and beetles, independently evolved the ability to grow fungi for food. Like humans, the insect farmers became dependent on cultivated crops for food and developed task-partitioned societies cooperating in gigantic agricultural enterprises. Agricultural life ultimately enabled all of these insect farmers to rise to major ecological importance.</p></blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/t/text/get-pdf?c=ctz;idno=7703a01">Gerhard Scholtz </a></p>
<blockquote><p>I suggest that an increased opportunity to observe pill rolling scarab beetles has inspired humans to invent the wheel.....</p>
<p>Dung beetles are attracted by the odour of fresh dung produced mainly by ungulates. They cut out pieces of dung and form a near-perfect bowl with a smooth surface by using their appendages and head structures. They then roll this bowl around to store it in excavated burrows as food for themselves or their offspring. By rolling the ball, they cover distances up to several meters while passing little elevations and valleys on their way....</p>
<p>I suggest that the invention of the wheel in human culture was merely a reinvention, copied from nature and from dung beetles in particular.</p></blockquote>
