<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">From  a system resilience viewpoint, there are many reasons why a reduction  in diversity is harmful. But one of the lesser appreciated benefits of a  diverse pool of firms in an industry is the impact it has in reducing  the political clout that the </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">industry</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> wields. Diversity is one of the best defences against crony capitalism.  As </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Luigi</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Zingales explains, commenting </span></span><a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/capitalism-after-the-crisis"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">here</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> on the political impact of </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gramm</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-Leach-</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bliley</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"The real effect of </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gramm</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-Leach-</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bliley</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was political, not directly  economic. Under the old regime, commercial banks, investment banks, and  insurance companies had different agendas, and so their lobbying efforts  tended to offset one another. But after the restrictions were lifted,  the interests of all the major players in the financial industry became  aligned, giving the industry disproportionate power in shaping the  political agenda. The concentration of the banking industry only added  to this power."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There's been a lot of  discussion recently on the merits of breaking up the big banks and one  of the arguments in favour of this policy is the perceived reduction in  the political clout that the banks would possess. Arnold </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kling</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, for example, lays out the thesis in this recent </span></span><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/429893/break-up-the-banks/arnold-kling?page=3"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">article</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Breaking up the banks may help but I  would argue that the impact of such a move on the political economy of  banking will be limited unless the industry becomes less homogenous. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The prime driver of this homogeneity  is the combination of the moral hazard subsidy and regulatory capital  guidelines which ensures that there is one optimal strategy that  maximises this subsidy and </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">outcompetes</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> all other strategies. This strategy is of course to maintain a highly  levered balance sheet invested in low capital-intensity, highly-rated  assets. </span></span></p>
