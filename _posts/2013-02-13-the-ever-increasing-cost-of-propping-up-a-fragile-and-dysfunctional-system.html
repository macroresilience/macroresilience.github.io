  content: "Believe it or not the best method of fire suppression is not to get to
    that point at all. A \"controlled burn\" of the wooded area or an open field prior
    to the need of fire suppression is the best method. No evacuation, little expense,
    no fighting a fire, low,low dollar and life losses. You get the needed growth
    of a forest or open field so it doesn't become overgrown with weeds, etc.\n\nAs
    you can see, the agricultural benefits of a controlled burn go much further than
    preventing a fire from occurring. \n\nFire lines or truck/car trails are very
    time-consuming but needed for fire prone areas. It is a lot easier to clear them
    now then have them cleared or make them when they are needed. It is much more
    than putting out the fire Itself. The greatest amount of time is making them.\n\nThat
    is why we have the DOF here in Florida. Fire departments don't fight the fire
    unless ask by DOF. They support the  Division  of Forestry who used tractors and
    bulldozers to cut the lines.  Fire Departments protect the structures.\n\nJim

  content: Jim - Thanks for the comment and the insight. I agree. Many of the posts
    on this blog focus on the stability-resilience tradeoff in complex systems which
    essentially means that preventing all disturbances eventually causes a catastrophic
    disturbance. Correspondingly, engineering small disturbances i.e. controlled burns
    can prevent catastrophic disturbances.
