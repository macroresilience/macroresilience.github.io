    The "universal bank" concept and the conglomerate financial institution, which owns, and strategically directs an array of subsidiary firms, with various functions and business models, poses an "ecological" threat that may have few good analogies in biology.

    The "competition" in any industry/market is likely to be both horizontal and vertical.  Horizontal competition comprises rivalry with firms with similar business models and strategies, as well as strategic competition against firms with differing business models, strategies and resource bases.  Vertical competition -- strategic interactions with customers and service vendors and suppliers -- is also an important discipline.

    If we imagine a relatively atomistic structure, in which autonomous firms are organized around possession of rent-yielding assets and business models centered on technically-efficient control of business processes, then the system as a whole may be resilient and adaptive, with firm birth and growth compensating for the hazards of firm contraction and liquidating bankruptcy.

    I'd risk a discursion to draw attention to the importance of control, in the sense of technical control of business processes to achieve administrative or technical efficiency.  Competition, financial reporting and financial leverage contribute to achieving effective control and technical efficiency.

    Submersion in conglomerate structure threatens all these sources of incentive pressure.  Leverage, which for the autonomous firm, can be a way for investors to overcome asymmetric information problems with the management, is lost to the larger entity.  The conglomerate may well mandate modifications to both vertical and horizontal rivalrous relationships.  It is not uncommon, to have the same conglomerate on both side of what was once an arm's length, "market-mediated" relationship.  Financial reporting, which might have once exposed the autonomous firm to a fair appraisal of risk and performance, is now an exercise in obscuring the performance of operating units in the larger whole.  And, the management of the operating unit, instead of grappling directly with the feedback from markets, is directed by an internal score-keeping system, which can acquire its own biases and quirks; gaming the score-keeping system can replace more realistic market-oriented management strategies.

    The universal bank, like the giant hydra in any industry, can begin to deliberately shape the ecology, which is the economy.  Just as Wal-Mart manages its prescription prices to discourage drug stores in its vicinity, so a CitiGroup may be in a position to decide whether a neighborhood should have a CitiBank, or a CitiFinancial office, with implications for promoting thrift or financial degeneracy, as the case may be.  WaMu, as I recall, at one point, bought a real estate appraiser; do we have to ask where that was headed?

    There have been somewhat comical instances of the same bank granting first and second mortgages on some big commercial real estate project, and then the bank has to sue itself in a "dispute" over the conflicting rights, when the deal comes apart.  But, really, what happened when the deal was being put together?  How much honest negotiation takes places, when the same giant corporation, sits on both sides of the table?

    The corrosion has the potential to spread like a slow cancer through the whole political economy, as the networks of universal banks spread out to entwine in alliances with the networks of other conglomerated industries, such as Big Media.

  content: 'Interesting discussion overall, thanks for the thoughts and the introduction
    to the sources and concepts, all of which are new to me. I''ve been thinking about
    "resilience" in the context of recovery from failure. In the late 1830s, a few
    of the 7 brothers in the Cheney family of my hometown, Manchester, Connecticut,
    became involved in the nascent silk production industry; many of the farmers in
    the area had taken to raising silkworms in their homes as a second business. The
    Cheney brothers tried to begin an industrial silkworm-raising mill business, but
    soon figured out that the real money was in mulberry leaves (to feed the silk
    worms). They shuttered the mill, and bought hundreds of acres land in New Jersey
    (near where I live now), where they raised hundreds of thousands of mulberry trees,
    along with some other producers. By 1841, the mulberry tree bubble had burst,
    and the Cheneys had lost all their land via sheriff''s sale. But by 1843, they
    were up and running again in their formerly shuttered mill building, this time
    as finishers of raw silk imported from Europe. It made my head spin to read about
    it, because they not only had to change the considerable mechanics of their business
    3 times within perhaps 5 or 6 years; they had to change their lobbying approach
    3 times as well (i.e., they lobbied, successfully, for 3 different, and conflicting,
    types of tariff protection over that short period). The third time was the charm,
    and they built an empire that lasted into the 1930s. What struck me was the speed
    with which they recovered from each prior failure. At least in those early years,
    they had no opportunity to ossify via too much focus on core clients'' demands:
    they didn''t even figure out who their "clients" were until the 3rd time around.'

  content: "\"if the universe of agent strategies is sufficiently diverse, a macro-system
    comprising of fragile, inflexible agents can be incredibly resilient.\"\n\nThis
    is the situation with cancer, which can be seen as the somatic evolution of massive
    diversity of strategies for cells.  Cancer cells are individually much less resilient
    than normal cells but can outcompete as a group of \"cronies\".  \n\nThe tragic
    irony is that the treatments we tend to gravitate towards in medicine create selective
    pressures that enhance rather than diminish the effectiveness of this carcinogenic
    cronyism."

    novelty and innovate thus enabling the system to &#8220;adapt in ways that exploit
    new resources or allow them to persist under unprecedented environmental regime
    shifts&#8221; (Whitacre 2010). At first glance, evolvability and robustness appear
    to be incompatible: Generation of novelty involves a leap into the dark, an exploration
    rather than an act of &#8220;rational choice&#8221; and the search for a beneficial
    innovation carries with it a significant risk of failure. It&#8217;s worth noting
    that in social systems, this dilemma vanishes in the absence of irreducible uncertainty.
    If all adaptations are merely a realignment to a known systemic configuration
    (&#8220;known&#8221; in either a deterministic or a probabilistic sense), then
    an inability to adapt needs other explanations such as organisational rigidity.

    wonder if Mr Burton Klein isn't engaging in circular arguments. Large organisations
    do innovate, just that they are unlikely to be able to invoke exponential growth
    once they have reached such a size. A small organisation may exhibit exponential
    growth and in the context of share-price/investor feedback loops is therefore
    more likely to induce alterations in the overall fabric. I also wonder what percentage
    of those innovations were somehow driven by ex-employees of large companies, who
    are incentivised in a free market to establish their own business around innovations,
    rather than offer the ideas up for free to unrewarding employers."

    Frank - Burton Klein does not claim that large firms do not innovate, just that they do not engage in exploratory innovation without being constantly prodded by new entrants into the industry to do so. This is a milder claim than say those of Clayton Christensen or James Utterback who essentially say that in almost all cases, it is new entrants that undertake disruptive innovation.

    The empirical case is on Christensen and Utterback's side, a fact that Klein also acknowledges. But Klein's milder thesis is sufficient for the macroeconomic implications that he goes on to derive in his work and which I use in my writings.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We shouldn't conflate this paralysis  with an absence of competition between the incumbents - the competition  between the incumbents may even be intense enough to ensure that they  retain only a small portion of the rents that they fight so desperately to retain.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The  best example of this is the OTC derivatives market which is the benefits  of TBTF to the big banks are most evident. Bob </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Litan</span></span> <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/Files/rc/papers/2010/0407_derivatives_litan/0407_derivatives_litan.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">notes</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that clients </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"wanted the comfort of knowing that  they were dealing with large, well-capitalized financial institutions" </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">when dealing in CDS</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and this observation holds for most  other OTC derivative markets. He also correctly identifies that the  crucial component of effective reform is removing the advantage that the </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Derivative  Dealers' Club" </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">currently  possess: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Systemic  risk also would be reduced with true derivatives market reforms that  would have the effect of removing the balance sheet advantage of the  incumbent dealers now most likely regarded as TBTF. If end-users know  that when their trades are completed with a clearinghouse, they are free  to trade with any market maker – not just the specific dealer with whom  they now customarily do business – that is willing to provide the right  price, the resulting trades are more likely to be the end-users’  advantage. In short, in a reformed market, the incumbent dealers would  face much greater competition." </span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Innovation in the financial sector is  also hampered because of the outsized contribution it already makes to  economic activity in the United States, which makes market-broadening  innovations extremely unlikely. James </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Utterback</span></span> <a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/erm0413.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">identified</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> how difficult it is for new entrants  to immediately substitute incumbent players: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Innovations that broaden a market  create room for new firms to start. Innovation-inspired substitutions  may cause established firms to hang on all the more tenaciously, making  it extremely difficult for an outsider to gain a foothold along with the  cash flow needed to expand and become a player in the industry." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Of course, the incumbents may  eventually break away from the local peak but an extended period of stagnation is  more likely. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sustaining an environment conducive to the entry of new firms  is critical to the maintenance of a resilient macroeconomy that is  capable of innovating and dealing with novelty. <strong>The very least that  financial sector reform must achieve is to eliminate the benefits of  TBTF that currently make it all but impossible for a new entrant to  challenge the status quo. </strong></span></span></p>
