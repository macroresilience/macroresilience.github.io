<p>I have written a new essay in the economics section of my new project reconciling the possibility of technological unemployment during a time of innovative stagnation titled <a href="http://alittledisorder.com/resilience-across-domains/economics/technological-unemployment-amidst-stagnation/">Technological Unemployment Amidst Stagnation</a>. Most of it is just a rehash of arguments that I have made on this blog especially in the posts <a href="/2011/11/02/innovation-stagnation-and-unemployment/">Innovation, Stagnation and Unemployment</a> and <a href="/2011/03/15/advances-in-technology-and-artificial-intelligence-implications-for-education-and-employment/">Advances in Technology and Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Education and Employment</a> but about 25-30% of the essay is new material and the overall essay itself is written in a much simpler manner than many of my posts here.</p>
<p>Do let me know what you think. Thanks for reading.</p>
