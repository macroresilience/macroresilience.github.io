    open a bank in the midst of a financial crisis where banks are falling left right

    Again, in Europe non-bank lending is already picking up simply because the funding
    advantage of TBTF is shrinking. Even if the govt needs to participate in equity
    infusion, I'd rather they seed new banks than save old ones. \n\n3. I'm neutral
    to deposit insurance for \"small\" amounts which used to be the case till the
    60s. and ban blatant arbitrage schemes like CDARS. At the very least, the levels
    of insurance need to come down dramatically in the US."

    \n\nif so then presumably reducing FDIC cover is a step that needs to be done
    first. Question is by how much?\n\nIf yes to that, then would you exclude corporates
    (who after all are holding the largest balances) from insurance? If so, how?"

    I often hear this argument made, but are there any actual quantitative studies on this?

    Nicolai - I mean Basel-style requirements.

    IMO, if we allow failure of banks, then capital requirements are not so important. Lower capital and more regular individual bank failure can even make the system as a whole more resilient by preventing connectivity from building up to excessive levels (similar to how regular fires build resilience in a forest). But this is not a critical point to the discussion above.

    Two problems with the above ashwin:

    1) You're picking losers, which is even worse than picking winners.

    2) In a micro-chaos setting, uninsured shadow banking should have most of the market. Micro chaos dominated by regulated banking entities runs counter to your own thesis.

    You are picking losers because you are assuming that insured deposits are more deserving than others. Given that we both decry the principle of deposit insurance it would be consistent to avoid doing that. A better plan is to start lowering the thresholds incrementally and then later let what's left of the risk free superstructure collapse - after all, its already collapsing if you measure the collapse by returns to risk free fixed income.

    I also think you might be being a bit hasty and underestimating how long the elasticity of the ZLB can prop things up.

    Lastly if you genuinely believe in the shadow sector as the long term future then crucifying it in favour of the currently regulated ponzi fixed income/insured sector risks tainting it forever in the eyes of the man on the street. If that happens, an autocracy is almost inevitable.

    "I don’t know what the future is and I don’t really care – happy to let the market figure that out."

    I think that is a flawed position. You cannot declare that the market is structurally unsound and at the same time appeal to it to sort things out. The market is a social construction that is ultimately underwritten by trust in its institutions. Its not a platonic reality.

    To address this I think you'd at least need to outline how you imagine the market structure might transpire post-collapse and how it might stabilise matters in the aftermath.

    Its not credible to proscribe a planned and deliberate (if only by the sin of omission) collapse and then leave the aftermath to to the invisible hand which is after all the greatest myth of out time, as I have outlined here:

    Let me rephrase it - you're asking me to predict the future. I have some thoughts on the subject obviously but nothing more. I think you'd see a system with very little maturity transformation for example.

    My main point regarding banking is that we need a system where failure is a possibility and a reality. It's the absence of this "invisible foot" that IMO is the problem with the industry and has infected much of the real economy as well.

    I fully agree that the future has to dispense with faux guarantees.

    But, I *am* asking you to predict the future because that's the ticket to play if you want to turn the oil tanker 180 degrees. In fact its not an oil tanker, its a passenger liner and one needs to pay attention to the views of the passengers.

    A solution proposal is only possible in reality with a vision of the future that people can buy into or at least discuss.

    As for maturity transformation I agree with that too - as long as deep financial markets continue to operate. IN fact I think we are already there mostly - most all funding is short term from the lender's POV and nobody holds a 25 year government bond to term.

    bank and corporate failure is that it will trigger off a catastrophic deflationary
    collapse in the economy while at the same time crippling the lending capacity
    available to businesses and households. \"\n\nIn your proposal, are you eliminating
    the FDIC?  With deposit insurance in place, there is zero reason for the government
    to step in and bail out banks.  Main street loses nothing, but the bank equity
    holders lose everything, as they should.  Even better would be to add double liability
    to equity holders plus hold executive bonuses and stock dividends in escrow for
    seven years.  \n\nNow that I read your comments ... I seem to be more of a fan
    of deposit insurance than you are.  I would actually make deposit insurance unlimited
    so as to give corporate investors a safe alternative to money market funds.  And
    if I was restructuring things right now, I would fold all current money market
    funds into normal FDIC backed accounts, and warn corporations against their use.
    \ As long as equity holders a) have substantial capital at stake b) are in a first
    loss position and c) have an incentive structure that makes the equity holders
    think long term (such as holding profits and bonuses in escrow), then deposit
    insurance will not create a moral hazard problem.  The equity holders control
    management of the bank, and the equity holders will have a very strong incentive
    to make good loans, because it will be their skin on the line.\n\nIf you're interested,

  content: "Devin - Thanks. As discussed in the comments, I don't think deposit insurance
    is at the heart of the current crisis (unlike say the S&amp;L crisis in the 80s).
    Enforcing losses on unsecured creditors should more than suffice in most cases.
    \n\nBanks have been bailed out and unsecured creditors made whole despite the
    presence of deposit insurance for many reasons. But the ones put forth most often
    are the ones I'm trying to tackle - deflationary collapse and collapse in lending
    capacity. \n\nYour banking proposals are essentially a set of regulations. My
    main problem with this approach is one I have gleaned from experience - that banks
    can and will game pretty much any regulation you can throw at them. I have a set
    of posts on similar topics under the category https://www.macroresilience.com/category/goodharts-law/
    . I wish we could regulate away the problem but the entire long arc of post-WW2
    financial market evolution is one of banks gradually building up the tools that
    enable them to circumvent any regulation that you can throw at them. Minsky is
    also excellent on this topic. \n\nJust to take your point on equityholders and
    escrow-like mechanisms enforcing discipline as an example, the \"innovation\"
    of synthetic derivatives allows banks to construct as negatively-skewed a bet
    as they want. So they can construct a bet which appears to be profitable for 29
    out of 30 years and then blows up catastrophically in the 30th losing a few hundred
    years worth of profit. For an outsider or regulator, it is impossible to regulate
    this behaviour. You need creditors to be vigilant and essentially have skin in
    the game so that they're not willing to lend at cheap rates and allow banks to
    lever themselves up."

    The question is , who would buy BoA assets in the event of a failure, and what would they pay for them? Let us assume that the other TBTF banks are also busy failing at the same time.

    Until the assets were successfully sold off the depositors couldn't get anything, after the FDIC funds had run out.

    "And the assets don’t exactly have to be sold instantaneously – FDIC can follow usual process for taking over and disposing of banks."

    FDIC was designed for dealing with individual failures, not a general bankruptcy of the whole sector.

    However assuming you are correct and depositors are kept whole after the banks they had been using are all wound up, where do they then place their deposits?

    This relates to my question about who would buy the assets I guess, since only new institutions having a substantial base of financial assets would be able to accommodate the deposits.

    Do the assets necessarily have to be sold? Couldn't the bank's unsecured liabilities instead be converted to equity? I'm no lawyer, but such an approach wouldn't seem to violate property rights. After all, it's not unusual in a bankruptcy for creditors to end up owning a company.


    It might actually be "fairer" to creditors; they'd be left in control and have a fighting chance of eventually recovering some of their losses. It would also leave well capitalised institutions in its wake, perhaps sufficiently so to begin to realistically deal with their more dubious assets.

    We're not talking about converting unsecured creditors to equity here, we are talking about:

    1) wiping out all unsecured creditors and equity holders completely.

    2) hoping that the banks assets can be *sold* to cover depositors and other secured creditors.

    Then assuming that is all OK, that there remains somewhere to deposit the deposits.

    I don't see what relevance the fate of unsecured creditors has to my questions above?

    Ashwin may have a different take, but I was suggesting "failed" banks be put through a form of chapter 11.

    Existing equity holders would almost certainly be wiped out, but unsecured creditors would not. Instead, they'd likely be left with full ownership. The need for the painful and uncertain steps you lay out would therefore be avoided.

    "Your banking proposals are essentially a set of regulations. My main problem with this approach is one I have gleaned from experience – that banks can and will game pretty much any regulation you can throw at them. "

    The main thrust of my proposal is to rely less on written regulation and more on incentives and personal discretion.  No insurance company should ever insure a risk it does not understand.  The FDIC executives should expel any bank that was creating synthetic assets or doing anything more than well tested, vanilla banking.  "This is too complex for me to understand and/or regulate" or "this just smells fishy" is a perfectly valid reason for the FDIC to expel a bank.  They are the insurance company, they decide who they wish to insure.  The FDIC executives and shareholders have a very good incentive to balance risk and reward.  If they are too tight, there would be no lending, and thus no fees from the FDIC insurance premiums.  If they are too loose, the banks blow up, and the executives and equity holders are extremely severely punished.  The political leaders only have to set exactly how severely punished in order to regulate the level of risk taking.  One could be as conservative as saying that if the FDIC goes bankrupt the executives should go to debtors prison, or as relaxed as only clawing back the last five years of bonuses.

    What is the anticipated magnitude of the Helicopter Drop?  How, exactly, is it determined?  I read the link, but the details are far from well developed.

    And how do we know what magnitudes and pacing of helicopter drops are adequate?

    I don't expect a full blown, detailed analysis, but your suggestion is worthy enough that it would be worth explore magnitudes a bit to see just how realistic this is.

  content: "Michael - The size of the helicopter drop depends upon the deflationary
    impact of allowing the incumbent banks to fail. If we did nothing, then simply
    allowing a collapse would probably lead to atleast a similar level of deflation
    as the banking collapse in the early 30s i.e. ~25%. \n\nBut the commitment of
    the helicopter drop itself should allow us to restructure the banks without such
    a collapse. New entrants and fresh capital may move in quicker on the basis that
    money supply will not be allowed to collapse. The aim should be to start small
    and build up if necessary. If the transfers result in an overshooting of the inflation
    target, then the excess can be mopped up with a simple consumption tax. Given
    the ease with which the program can be ramped up, my preferred approach would
    be to tinker cautiously and re-evaluate constantly. \n\nThe need for such a program
    is primarily driven by the fragility of our current economy which has been brought
    on by past errors. In a resilient economy, the amount of such transfers needed
    should be minimal. \n\nAlso, when intervention is needed I'd rather intervene
    with an equitable, neutral policy rather than doling out fiscal favours or bailing
    out banks."

  content: "\"Transfers must not be directed to corporate entities – even uncertain
    tail-risk protection provided to corporates will eventually be gamed.\"\n\nAn
    analogy with breaking out of prison is I believe, appropriate here. Just because
    we have not succeeded in gainfully regulating the market place doesn't mean there
    are regulatory tools that are available that have not been tried that would work
    against the gaming of the system.\n\nHaving said that, I agree that the massive
    payments to individuals are the best way to accomplish the goal of economic recovery.
    Matching those however, I see a step zero that needs to be taken first to initialize
    the system for a recovery-a new infrastructure-one that looks better than the
    present -can we have some wilderness in our backyards for god's sake instead of
    relegating it to areas 700 miles out? Also can the urban sprawl with 1200 square
    miles of brick, mortar, glass, cement and pavement be contained? Destroying the
    ecological relationships around us to build urban areas is suicidal. Rebuilding
    the urban areas should include massive fiscal spending for cultural events (concerts
    of all genres, theater, movies, books, poetry, sculpture, architecture) mass transit
    and public housing. Again past failures in these endeavors can only point the
    way to future success. \n\nOnce the individual safety net (public health care
    \ widely available with low cost clinics in every neighborhood) was nurtured,
    \ broadened and in general made much more muscular, the need for payments to individuals
    would eventually drop away as the difference in quality between privately owned
    property and public property fell away as the public aspect of life in its overall
    quality would rise well above anything all but very few individuals could afford."

---
<p>The core logic behind my critique of macroeconomic stabilisation is that stability (and stabilisation) breeds systemic fragility. But this does not imply an opposition to all macroeconomic intervention, especially in a scenario when past stabilisation has left the macroeconomy in a fragile state. It simply insists on restricting our interventions to actions that preserve the essential adaptive character and creative destruction of our economic system.</p>
<p>A resilient framework of macroeconomic interventions must satisfy the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>focus on mitigating the most damaging consequences of disturbances</strong> on the macroeconomy rather than stamping out the disturbance at its source.</li>
<li>a <strong>focus on discretionary interventions targeted at individuals</strong> rather than corporate limited-liability entities and limited to times of systemic crises.</li>
<li><strong>emphasis on maintaining general economic capacities and competences</strong> rather than protecting the specific incumbent entities that provide an economic function at any given point of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory monetary and fiscal policy interventions can easily fulfil all these criteria. In practise however, the history of both interventions is characterised by a systematic violation of all of them. The long history of propping up insolvent financial institutions via the TBTF guarantee and central bank ‘liquidity facilities’ combined with the doling out of fiscal favours to incumbent corporates has left us with a fragile and unequal economic system. As Michael Lewis <a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2011/10/04/michael-lewis-wall-streets-fingerprints?videoId=222228347">puts it</a>, we have <em>“socialism for the capitalists and capitalism for everybody else”</em> and the system shows no signs of changing despite the abysmal results so far. To paraphrase <a href="http://robertreich.org/post/11033625495">Robert Reich</a>, behind every potential “resolution” of a debt crisis lies yet another bailout for the banks.</p>
<p>The pro-bailout proponents argue that there is no other option. According to them, allowing the banks to fail will bring about a certain economic collapse. In this post, I will argue against this notion that bank bailouts are inevitable and unavoidable. I will also lay out a coherent and simple alternative policy program to get us out of the mess that we’re currently in without having to undergo a systemic collapse to do so.</p>
<p>My policy proposal has three legs all of which need to be implemented simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allow Failure</strong>: Allow insolvent banks and <a href="/2011/10/03/macroeconomic-stabilisation-and-financialisation-in-the-real-economy/">financialised corporations</a> to fail.</li>
<li><strong>The Helicopter Drop</strong>: Institute a system of <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/918.html">direct transfers</a> to individuals (a helicopter drop) to mitigate the deflationary fallout from bank failure.</li>
<li><strong>Entry of New Banks</strong>: Allow fast-track approvals of new banks to restore banking capacity in the economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument against allowing bank and corporate failure is that it will trigger off a catastrophic deflationary collapse in the economy while at the same time crippling the lending capacity available to businesses and households. The helicopter drop of direct transfers helps prevent a deflationary collapse and the entry of new banks helps maintain lending capacity thus negating both concerns.</p>
<p><strong>The Helicopter Drop</strong></p>
<p>In order to promote system resilience and minimise moral hazard, any system of direct transfers must be directed only at individuals and it must be a discretionary policy tool utilised only to mitigate against the risk of systemic crises. The discretionary element is crucial as tail risk protection directed at individuals has minimal moral hazard implications if it is uncertain even to the slightest degree. <strong>Transfers must not be directed to corporate entities - even uncertain tail-risk protection provided to corporates will eventually be gamed.</strong> The critical difference between individuals and corporates in this regard is the ability of stockholders and creditors to spread their bets across corporate entities and ensure that failure of any one bet has only a limited impact on the individual investors’ finances. In an individual’s case, the risk of failure is by definition concentrated and the uncertain nature of the transfer will ensure that moral hazard implications are minimal. This conception of transfers as a macro-intervention tool is very different from ideas that assume constant, regular transfers or a steady safety net such as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_guarantee">income guarantee</a>, <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2009/08/job-guarantee.html">job guarantee</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit">social credit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Entry of New Banks</strong></p>
<p>I have discussed in a previous <a href="/2010/07/12/bank-capital-and-the-monetary-transmission-channel-the-importance-of-new-firm-entry/">post</a> why entry of new banks allows us to preserve bank lending capacity without bailing out the incumbent banks. A similar <a href="http://alephblog.com/2009/01/10/a-new-goal-for-tarp-money-create-mutual-banks/">idea</a> has been laid out by David Merkel as a more resilient way to undertake TARP-like interventions. The fundamental principle is quite simple - system <a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/">resilience</a> refers to the ability to retain the same <strong>function</strong> while adapting to a disturbance. It does not imply that the function must be provided by the same incumbent entities. In fact, we are already beginning to see an <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a57f30b0-ef41-11e0-918b-00144feab49a.html">expansion in non-bank credit</a> as the era of low borrowing costs due to the implicit guarantee to bank creditors <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f56688ec-d963-11e0-b52f-00144feabdc0.html">comes to an end</a>. New banks unencumbered by the need to make up their past losses will be much better positioned to meet the credit demand from the real economy.The process of new firm entry in banking can be encouraged in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast-track approvals</li>
<li>Reduced capital requirements</li>
<li>TARP-like seed capital participation as David Merkel has <a href="http://alephblog.com/2009/01/10/a-new-goal-for-tarp-money-create-mutual-banks/">laid out</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many commentators have criticised the ‘Occupy Wall Street’ movement for not having an agenda and a list of demands. But as Michael Lewis <a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2011/10/04/michael-lewis-wall-streets-fingerprints?videoId=222228347">points out</a>, their protests are not without merit. The slogan <a href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/">‘We are the 99 percent’</a> captures the essence of the problem which is the explosion of the share of the national income captured by the richest 1% of the population. If this inequality was perceived to be fair or if it had occurred at a time of prosperity for the masses, it is unlikely that there would have been any protest at all. But as I have pointed out, the rise in income captured by the richest 1% is primarily driven by the <a href="(https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/09/23/inequality-and-moral-hazard-rents-in-the-financial-sector/)">rents captured</a> by and through the financial sector. The same doctrine of macroeconomic stabilisation that acted as the source of these rents has also transformed the economy into a <a href="/2011/10/03/macroeconomic-stabilisation-and-financialisation-in-the-real-economy/">financialised</a> and <a href="/2010/11/24/the-cause-and-impact-of-crony-capitalism-the-great-stagnation-and-the-great-recession/">cronyist</a> system unable to sustain a broad-based and sustainable recovery. <strong>Simply allowing the failure of insolvent banks and financialised corporations and putting an end to the flow of rents towards the banks will go a long way towards reducing the level of inequality in the economy. At the same time, the entry of new firms will restore the economy’s competitive and innovative dynamism.</strong></p>
