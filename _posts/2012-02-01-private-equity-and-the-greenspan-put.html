  content: So why is the whole screaming about the threatened capitalism? This is
    not capitalism. The corporations are in charge via the politicians, combined with
    aggressive militarism toward the inferior nondemocratic "others" - fascism. And
    party troubadours /Fukuyama for example/ exalts the forever lasting liberal democracy
    /what a hypocrisy, we have stupid oligarchy/. It is all lies and crap..

  content: 'Don''t get me wrong, I am not trying to insult you in any way. Even if
    my words touch some painful meme, it is your mental construct that gives you pain.
    USA is empire, an empire in decline. I find very frustrating your focus over economic/utilitarian
    domain. An empire functions by projecting pseudo-democratic "face" in front of
    the domestic "public" and exercising ruthless colonial operations "abroad". An
    empire in decline means the situation is no longer sustainable. There are few
    possible scenarios: 1) Rapid technological advancement, combined with swift change
    of part of the ruling elites /call it reform/ 2) meta-stable downward trend /status
    quo/ 3) collapse /the "elites" forcefully complete the prevailing trend towards
    fascism/. Scenario one is by my view the most desirable. The technological change
    will not be supported by the pseudo-republican wankers and their masters from
    the corporations. Like it or not most of these "elites" are mentally infantile
    and completely incapable for the task, nevertheless they concentrate the economic
    and political power. By technological advancement I don''t mean stupid ways to
    milk the kids like facebook, but entirely new class of technology, something unaccessible
    by the majority of present "elites". As for scenario two, it is meta-stable in
    short run, especially with the bunch of warmongering monkeys who are pushing US
    towards another war. Scenario three does not allow any predictions about time
    to be made. It will reveal very fast, unexpected, and US will becomes militarized
    despotism that will last probably few years, millions will die /mostly abroad/,
    the current elites will be completely eradicated and US will get nice, pleasant
    socialism /from contemporary point of view/. So the whole concert about the democracy
    and blah, blah.. future dominance as the only possible way to develop is well..
    stupid people who are attached to the present elites and believe by running the
    usual propaganda their cognitive dissonance will magically disappear. There is
    no way to repair the "crony capitalism" as you call it via political process.
    The "democracy" /even being pseudo/ will not allow it. The politicians are installed
    there not by the masses /this is why I call it oligarchy/ but by the capital via
    the high level operatives in the corporations.'

<p>Mitt Romney’s campaign for the Republican nomination for the US Presidential election has triggered a debate as to the role of private equity (PE) in the economy. The critical of the private equity industry tend to focus on their perceived tendency to layoff employees and increase leverage. Regarding layoffs, there is very little <a href="http://www.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/PE/2011/08967.pdf">evidence</a> that PE firms are worse than the rest of the corporate sector. However, this does not imply that their role is entirely positive. But it does imply that the excesses of PE mirror the excesses of the larger economy during the neoliberal era. This is obvious when the role of leverage is examined. As Mike Konczal <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-debate-on-private-equity-in-1989-peter-rona-addressing-jensen/">notes</a>, <em>“something did change during the 1980s, and LBO was part of this overall shift.”</em> The road that started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout">LBOs</a> in the 1980s ended with the rash of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2012/01/30/120130ta_talk_surowiecki#ixzz1l37qMoSb">dividend recapitalisations</a> between 2003–2007, a phenomenon that has even <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c0003ec4-edbd-11df-9612-00144feab49a.html#axzz15a9NJKVF">resurfaced</a> post the crisis.</p>
<p>It is easy to find proximate causes for this dynamic and commentators on both sides of the political spectrum attribute much of the above to the neo-liberal revolution - the doctrine of shareholder value maximisation, high-powered managerial incentives, a drive towards increased efficiency etc. The acceleration of this process in the last decade usually gets explained away as the inevitable consequence of a financial bubble with irrationally exuberant banks making unwise loans to fuel the leverage binge. But these narratives miss the obvious elephant in the room - the role of monetary policy and in particular the dominant monetary policy doctrine underpinning the ‘Great Moderation’ which focused on shoring up financial asset prices as the primary channel of monetary stimulus, otherwise known as the ‘Greenspan Put’. <strong>All the above proximate causes were the direct and inevitable result of economic actors seeking to align themselves to the central banks’ focus on asset price stabilisation.</strong></p>
<p>As I elaborated upon in an earlier <a href="/2011/10/03/macroeconomic-stabilisation-and-financialisation-in-the-real-economy/">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>creating any source of stability in a capitalist economy incentivises economic agents to realign themselves to exploit that source of security and thereby reduce risk. Similar to how banks' adaptation to the <a href="/2011/09/12/bagehots-rule-central-bank-incentives-and-macroeconomic-resilience/">intervention strategies preferred by central banks</a> by taking on more “macro” risks,<strong> macro-stabilisation incentivises real economy firms to shed idiosyncratic micro-risks and take on financial risks instead. Suppressing nominal volatility encourages economic agents to shed real risks and take on nominal risks.</strong> In the presence of the Greenspan/Bernanke put, a strategy focused on “macro” asset price risks and leverage outcompetes strategies focused on “risky” innovation. Just as banks that exploit the guarantees offered by central banks outcompete those that don’t, <strong>real economy firms that realign themselves to become more bank-like outcompete those that choose not to</strong>…….When central bankers are focused on preventing significant pullbacks in equity prices (the Greenspan/Bernanke put), then real-economy firms are incentivised to take on more systematic risk and reduce their idiosyncratic risk exposure.</p></blockquote>
<p>The focus on cost reduction and layoffs is also a result of this increased market-sensitivity combined with the macro-stabilisation commitment encourages low-risk process innovation and discourages uncertain and exploratory product innovation. The excesses of some forms of private equity are often instances in which they apply the maximum possible leverage to extract the rents available via the Greenspan Put. Dividend recaps are one such instance.</p>
<p>James Kwak <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/01/27/what-is-private-equity/">summarises</a> the case of Simmons Bedding Company:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2003, for example, THL bought Simmons (the mattress company) for $327 million in cash and $745 million in debt. In 2004, Simmons (now run by THL) issued more debt and paid a $137 million dividend to THL; in 2007, it issued yet more debt and paid a $238 million dividend to THL. Simmons filed for bankruptcy in 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious question here is why banks and financial institutions would lend so much money and allow firms to lever up so dramatically. Kwak lays the blame on the financial bubble, principal-agent problems, bankers bonus structures etc. TED <a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2012/01/rape-of-persephone.html">counters</a> that lenders do in fact typically make informed decisions and also correctly points out that the rest of corporate America is not immune to such leveraged mishaps either. Both explanations ignore the fact that this sort of <strong>severely tail-risk heavy loan is exactly the payoff which maximises the banks‘ and their employees’ own <a href="/2010/01/06/implications-of-moral-hazard-in-banking/">moral hazard rent extraction</a></strong>. In an earlier <a href="/2010/09/23/inequality-and-moral-hazard-rents-in-the-financial-sector/">post</a>, I identified that many hedge fund strategies are an indirect beneficiary of moral hazard rents - the same argument also applies to some private equity strategies.</p>
<p>But as I have noted on <a href="/2010/03/07/stability-as-profound-moral-hazard/">many occasions</a>, the moral hazard problem from tail-risk hungry TBTF financial institutions is simply the tip of the iceberg. It was not only the banks with access to cheap leverage that were heavily invested in “safe” assets, but also asset managers, money market mutual funds and even ordinary investors. <strong>The Greenspan/Bernanke Put incentivises a large proportion of real and financial actors in the economy into taking on more and more tail risk with the expectation that the Fed will avoid any outcomes where these risks will be realised.</strong></p>
<p>Too many commentators fail to recognise that so much of what has made the neo-liberal era a thinly disguised corporate welfare state can be traced to the impact of a supposedly “neutral” macroeconomic policy instrument that in reality has grossly regressive consequences.<strong> To expect corporate America to not take advantage of the free lunch offered to it by the Fed is akin to dangling a piece of meat in front of a tiger and expecting it not to bite your hand off.</strong></p>
