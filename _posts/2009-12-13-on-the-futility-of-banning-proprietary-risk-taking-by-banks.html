  content: "The financial sector financing the risky (client) activity is like owning
    debt in it – the maximum upside is limited while the maximum downside is 100%.
    The sector engaging itself in the same risky activity (proprietary business) has
    potentially unlimited upside/downside.  At a systemic level it is immaterial who
    owns that risk. Let us assume (i) the general amount of risk taking in the system
    is a function of available leverage and opportunities; (ii) is independent of
    the existence of likes of Glass–Steagall Act and (iii) no firms/banks are bailed
    out. In such a scenario whenever the loss at a risk taking venture (bank or not)
    exceeds the equity available, the extra loss is borne by the system (not the taxpayer
    in this case). Now if one category of creditors (e.g. small deposit holders) needs
    to be protected from this – they need to pay a premium for it and swap the counterparty
    risk of the bank by the sovereign risk. \nGlass–Steagall or not, until you don’t
    rid the system of bailout mentality there will be remain inefficiencies and asymmetric
    payoffs (profit privatisation &amp; loss socialisation)."

Quoting from the interview:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">"</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">SPIEGEL:</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> Banking should become boring again?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Volcker</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">:</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> Banking will never be boring. Banking is a risky business. They are going to have plenty of activity. They can do underwriting. They can do securitization. They can do a lot of lending. They can do merger and acquisition advice. They can do investment management. These are all client activities. What I don't want them doing is piling on top of that risky capital market business. That also leads to conflicts of interest."</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">This is a more nuanced version of the argument that calls for the  reinstatement of the Glass-</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Steagall</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> Act. But it suffers from two fatal flaws:</span></p>

As I've discussed <a href="/2009/12/05/regulatory-arbitrage-and-the-efficiency-resilience-tradeoff/">previously</a>, a detailed and fine-tuned regulatory policy will  be easy to arbitrage and a blunt policy will result in a grossly inefficient financial system.<br />

<li style="text-align: justify;"><span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Losses on "Client Activities" were the major driver in the current crisis.</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span><a href="/2009/11/06/a-rational-explanation-of-the-financial-crisis/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">My analysis</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> of the </span><a href="http://www.ubs.com/1/ShowMedia/investors/releases?contentId=140331&amp;name=080418ShareholderReport.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">UBS shareholder report</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> highlighted how the accumulation of super-senior CDO tranches was justified primarily by their perceived importance in facilitating the sale of fee-generating junior tranches to clients. It is the losses on these tranches issued in the name of facilitating client business that were at the core of the crisis. It is these tranches that caused the majority of the losses on banks' balance sheets. It is losses on insuring these tranches that brought down AIG. Segregated proprietary risk is monitored closely by almost all banks. The real villain of the piece was proprietary risk taken on under the cover of facilitating client business. </span></span><span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span></li>
