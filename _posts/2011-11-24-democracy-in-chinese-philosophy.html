<p>From A.C. Graham's magisterial work <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812690885/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwmacror-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0812690885">'Disputers of the Tao'</a>Â (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>No one questions that government is by nature authoritarian; if an alternative is seen to rule by legitimate force it is the abolition or minimisation of government, leaving people to organise their affairs by custom. <strong>There are theoretical anarchists in ancient China, but no democrats.</strong></p></blockquote>
