  content: 'this is why the seizure of fannie mae and freddie mac and the wiping out
    of shareholder''s equity including preferred equity that counted as tier 1 capital
    in the banking system was economically idiotic, though politically much applauded:
    those entities operated with a govt guarantee of their debt, so could never become
    insolvent in the sense of being unable to meet liabilities as they come due. they
    don''t need accounting equity, which makes it silly for the govt to inject "equity"
    into them as losses eat thru the accounting equity line item. and of course the
    govt is not putting equity in at all--it is just issuing more debt and calling
    it equity. but the seizure of the gse''s did wipe out real equity of common and
    preferred shareholders, whom the govt had encouraged to invest in those entities
    earlier in the year. the completely gratuitous preferred dividend elimination
    also eliminated capital from the banking system at the same time as treasury was
    telling banks to raise more capital. no wonder it only took 7 days from that for
    lehman to fail, merrill to be sold, aig to collapse etc. premptive seizure led
    to preemptive action to get one''s cash out of financial institutions that might
    be the next to be seized.'

  content: Bill - I agree. Forcing a writedown of the equity when the debt is guaranteed
    may look good in the press but is economically meaningless.

In his words: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Without adequate leverage,  markets do not provide a rate of return on financial assets high enough  to attract capital to that activity. Yet at too great a degree of  leverage, bank solvency is at risk." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Greg </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mankiw</span></span> <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2010/03/comments-on-alan-greenspans-crisis.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">wonders</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> whether the above assertion does not  violate the Modigliani-Miller Theorem and is right to do so. Although </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Greenspan's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> conclusion is correct, his argument is  incomplete and misses out on the key reason why leverage matters for  banks - the implicit and explicit creditor guarantee. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I explained the impact of creditor  protection on banks' optimal leverage in my first </span></span><a href="../2009/11/06/a-rational-explanation-of-the-financial-crisis/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">note</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The conclusions which I summarised  in a more concise form in this </span></span><a href="../2010/01/06/implications-of-moral-hazard-in-banking/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">note</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> are as follows: Even a small  probability of a partial bailout will reduce the rate of return demanded  by bank creditors and this reduction constitutes an increase in firm  value. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In a  simple Modigliani-Miller world, the optimal leverage for a bank is  therefore infinite. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Even without invoking Modigliani-Miller, the argument for this  is intuitive.</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> If  each incremental unit of debt is issued at less than its true  economic cost due to deposit insurance or the TBTF doctrine, it  "increases the size of the pie" and adds to firm value. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In reality of course, there are many  limits to leverage, the most important being regulatory capital  requirements.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Indeed,  the above is the main reason why we have any regulatory capital  requirements at all. In the absence of regulation, a bank with blanket  creditor protection will likely choose to operate with minimal equity capital  especially when it has negligible franchise value or is insolvent.  This is exactly what happened during the S&amp;L crisis when  bankrupt S&amp;</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ls</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> with negligible franchise value bet  the farm on the back of a capital structure almost completely funded by  insured deposits. </span></span></p>
