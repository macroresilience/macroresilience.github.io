  content: "While the entire media circus centers around the crash, I am asking who
    was responsible for the resurgent buying spree?  Every professional and day trader
    will admit that the 70% rebound in the market was \"fake\" and therefore a prudent
    trader has his finger on the sell button waiting for the collapse.  \n\nI'm not
    sure how many traders had their finger on the buy button, or had a trade executed
    in their favor during those volatile 6 to 10 minutes.  I would contend that the
    only people that got favorable executions were the very ones that instigated the
    tremendous decline.  \n\nFinally, little has been noted that the legislation to
    audit the Fed and also bolster bank reforms were being discussed during the exact
    time of the market rout.  If nothing, the experience left politicians keenly aware
    of what happens to the \"economy\" when you attempt to throttle the bankers."

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Most explanations of the crash either  focus on the proximate cause of the crash or blame it all on the </span></span><a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/05/10/226261/barcap-on-that-flash-crash-a-perfect-storm/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"perfect  storm"</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The "perfect storm" explanation absolves us from analysing  the crash too closely, the implicit conclusion being that such an event  doesn't occur too often and not much needs to or can be done to prevent  its recurrence. There are two problems with this explanation. For one,  it violates Occam's Razor - it is easy to construct an ex-post </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">facto</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> explanation that depends upon a confluence of events that have not occurred together before. And more  crucially, perfect storms seem to occur all too often. As Jon Stewart </span></span><a href="http://politicallyillustrated.com/index.php?/news_page/iw/1122/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">put it</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Why is it that whenever something happens to the  people that should’ve seen it coming didn’t see coming, it’s blamed on  one of these rare, once in a century, perfect storms that for some  reason take place every f--king two weeks. I’m beginning to think these  are not perfect storms. I’m beginning to think these are regular storms  and we have a </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">sh</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">--</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ty</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> boat."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The focus on proximate causes ignores  the complexity and nonlinearity of market systems. Michael </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mauboussin</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> explained it best when he </span></span><a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Eadamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/shift.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">remarked</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Cause and effect thinking is dangerous. Humans  like to link effects with causes, and capital markets activities are no  different. For example, politicians created numerous panels after the  market crash in 1987 to identify its “cause.” A nonlinear approach,  however, suggests that large-scale changes can come from small-scale  inputs. As a result, cause-and-effect thinking can be both simplistic  and counterproductive." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The true underlying causes may be far removed from the effect,  both in time and in space and the proximate cause may only be the “straw  that broke the camel’s back”.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So what is the true underlying cause of the crash? In my  opinion, the crash was the inevitable consequence of a progressive loss  of system resilience. Why and how has the system become fragile? A  static view of markets frequently attributes loss of resilience to the  presence of positive feedback processes such as margin calls on levered  bets, stop-loss orders, dynamic hedging of short-gamma positions and  even just plain vanilla momentum trading strategies - Laura </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kodres</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">' paper </span></span><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ggy9wWmZuCoC&amp;lpg=PA1928&amp;pg=PA1994#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">here</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> has an excellent discussion on "</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">destabilizing</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">" hedge fund strategies. However, in a  dynamic conception of markets, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a resilient market is characterised not by the absence of  positive feedback processes but by the presence of a balanced and  diverse mix of positive and negative feedback processes.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Policy measures that aim to  stabilise the system by countering the impact of positive feedback  processes select against and weed out negative feedback processes -  Stabilisation reduces system resilience. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The decision to cancel errant trades is  an example of such a measure. It is critical that all market  participants who implement positive feedback strategies (such as  stop-loss market orders) suffer losses and those who step in to buy in  times of chaos i.e. the negative-feedback providers are not denied of  the profits that would accrue to them if markets recover. This is the  real damage done by policy paradigms such as the "</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Greenspan</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">/</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bernanke</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Put" that implicitly protect asset markets. They leave us with a fragile  market prone to collapse even with a "normal storm", unless there is  further intervention as we saw from the EU/ECB. Of course, every  subsequent intervention that aims to stabilise the system only further  reduces its resilience. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As positive feedback processes become increasingly dominant,  even normal storms that were easily absorbed earlier will cause a </span></strong></span><a href="../2010/04/11/the-magnetar-trade/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">catastrophic  transition</span></strong></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in the system.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> There are many examples of the loss of system resilience  being characterised by its vulnerability to a "normal" disturbance, such  as in </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Minsky's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Financial Instability Hypothesis or  Buzz Holling's conception of ecological resilience, both of which I have  discussed </span></span><a href="../2009/12/06/minskys-financial-instability-hypothesis-and-hollings-conception-of-resilience-and-stability/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">earlier</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Role of Waddell &amp; Reed</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the framework I have  outlined above, the appropriate question to ask of the </span></span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64D42W20100514"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Waddell &amp;  Reed affair</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> is whether their sell order was a "normal" storm or an  "abnormal" storm? More specifically, pinning the blame on a single order  requires us to prove that each time in the past an order of this size  was executed, the market crashed in a similar manner. It is also  probable that the sell order itself was a component of a positive  feedback hedging strategy and Waddell's statement that it was selling  the futures to </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"protect  fund investors from downside risk" </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">confirms this assessment. In this case, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the Waddell sell order was an  endogenous event in the framework and not an exogenous shock. Mitigating  the impact of such positive feedback strategies only makes the system  less resilient in the long run. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As Taleb </span></span><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=asIfMkujHP5k"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">puts it</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">: "When a bridge collapses, you don’t  look at the last truck that was on it, you look at the engineer. You’re  looking for the straw that broke the camel’s back. Let’s not worry about  the straw, focus on the back." Or as Jon Stewart would say, let's  figure out why we have a </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">sh</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">--</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ty</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> boat. </span></span></p>
