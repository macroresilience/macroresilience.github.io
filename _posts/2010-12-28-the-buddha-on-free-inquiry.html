<p>“Do not accept anything on mere hearsay (ie, thinking that thus have we heard it for a long time).</p>
<p>Do not accept anything by mere tradition (ie, thinking that it has been handed down thus through many generations).</p>
<p>Do not accept anything on account of rumours (ie, by believing what others say without any investigation).</p>
<p>Do not accept anything just because it accords with your scriptures.</p>
<p>Do not accept anything by mere supposition.</p>
<p>Do not accept anything by mere inference.</p>
<p>Do not accept anything by merely considering the appearances.</p>
<p>Do not accept anything merely because it agrees with your preconceived notions.</p>
<p>Do not accept anything merely because it seems acceptable (ie, should be accepted).</p>
<p>Do not accept anything thinking that the ascetic is respected by us (and that therefore it is right to accept his word.)</p>
<p>But when you know for yourselves - these things are immoral, these things are blameworthy, these things are censured by the wise, these things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to ruin and sorrow - then reject them.</p>
<p>When you know for yourselves - these things are moral, these things are blameless, these things are praised by the wise, these things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to well-being and happiness - then live and act accordingly.”</p>
