<p>The similarity between the concept of <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShuHaRi">Shu-Ha-Ri</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition</a> is well known. Both focus on a common theme - as one moves from being a novice at an activity to being an expert, the role of rules and algorithms in guiding our actions diminishes. They are instead replaced with an intuitive tacit understanding.</p>
<p>What is less commonly known is their common origin in the Chinese philosophical tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism">Taoism</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus">Hubert Dreyfus</a> was deeply influenced by the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a> who in turn was deeply <a href="http://chungsoolee.com/poggeler.html">influenced</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Lao-Tzu</a>. Shu-Ha-Ri is of course intimately <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=140gWoCBJLsC&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">connected</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen">Zen Buddhism</a> which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Zen">grounded</a> in Taoist philosophy.</p>
