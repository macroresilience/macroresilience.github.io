  content: "One thing I'd like to touch upon is that weightloss system fast may \nbe
    possible by the correct diet and exercise. Your size not only affects the \nlook,
    but also the overall quality of life. Self-esteem, melancholy, health risks, and
    \nphysical capabilities are disturbed in putting on weight.\nIt is possible to
    make everything right and still gain. In such a circumstance, \na condition may
    be the root cause. While excessive food and not enough \nexercise are usually
    guilty, common medical ailments and widespread prescriptions can easily greatly
    increase \nsize. Thanks a bunch for your post here."

    But, I do think it is good to open your blog/journal for comments, coz somehow
    it is still very encouraging to have people responding to what you have wrote.
    ^^ eh well, just feel you are a very poor guy  having to reply to dozens of  messages  everyday,
    which seems never-ending sigh  T_T honestly, I feel frustrated whenever I come
    across  comments  like these  it is just like a cycle  newbies step into the gothic   lolita
    field. After acquiring certain knowledge about the scene, they start to fighting
    against each other verbally with a view to confirm theirselves as an eligible
    one And one more thing, it''s a trend I guess. Many people nowadays are impulse-driven:
    Responding without reading and thinking thoroughly about the 6Ws. (that''s why
    I say you are poor)XDXD~ perhaps let''s put an end to this discussion, shall we?
    because the next debate will be staged somewhere again one day UNLESS we all learn
    how to accept and appreciate others. ^^ p.s. my comments are in fact very local
    and rude( in cantonese~ because I was too tired when I gave the comment~ )'

    I dont know in what sense you mean that there needs to be a little bit of disorder, for that people need to be able to cope with a little disorder and for that to be possible they need to be able to think for themselves.  I am not going to comment on that but how many people you know can TRUELY think for themselves?  And if you think they could you'll probably find that when they encounter a little bit of disorder they won't be able to handle it.

    The problem with people today is they have full fridges and spend all their free time watching XFactor and reality tv

<blockquote>We all strive for safety, prosperity, comfort, long life, and dullness. The deer strives with his supple legs, the cowman with trap and poison, the statesman with pen, the most of us with machines, votes, and dollars, but it all comes to the same thing: peace in our time. A measure of success in this is all well enough, and perhaps is a requisite to objective thinking, but <strong>too much safety seems to yield only danger in the long run</strong>. Perhaps this is behind Thoreau's dictum: In wildness is the salvation of the world. Perhaps this is the hidden meaning in the howl of the wolf, long known among mountains, but seldom perceived among men.</p></blockquote>

<p>The last line of the above quote refers to how wolves in their predatory role protect the mountains from being denuded by herbivores such as deers.</p>
