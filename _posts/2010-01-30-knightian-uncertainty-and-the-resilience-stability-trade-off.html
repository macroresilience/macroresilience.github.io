    Do you see any link from Knightian uncertainty towards an account of the Equity Premium Puzzle? That is, agents might have risk aversions in the reasonable range but still require extra incentive to make investments in the presence of substantial/irreducible uncertainty.

    Also, any thoughts on the use of subjective expected utility in macro and finance? SEU seems to collapse uncertainty into risk, but Savage was wary of doing this in settings where it is impossible always to "look before you leap".

    buying bank debt and other instruments based on the no lehmans polcies.  The biggest
    surprise of the next year could be the a run on a major bank and the inability
    of the government to save the institutions. I see a very complancent attitude
    that the government can indeed prevent all tail events, but reality is the damn
    they are trying to plug is getting absolutely massive with few policy tricks left.

    has multiple strategies that are working in separate areas at the same time.\n\nThe
    more entities manage for total return, the more unstable the financial system
    becomes.  \n\nStability only comes to markets in a self-reinforcing mode, from
    buy and hold (and sell and sit on cash) investors who act at the turning points.\n\nMarkets
    are more akin to ecologies than physics experiments.  When the ecology is diverse,
    but with variability, it is most robust."

    an explanation to the equity premium puzzle. Having said that, I tend to believe
    that equity risk premium is time-varying and frequently approaches zero. But that's
    another post entirely! \n\nAnd yes, in my view the main problem with SEU and modern
    finance/macro is not that it ignores irrationality/\"animal spirits\", but that
    it ignores uncertainty and more specifically evolution/adaptation under uncertainty."

    crises with an eventual high-intensity crisis. The best and most relevant example
    in ecology is the history of forest fire suppression in the United States which
    has prevented frequent low-intensity fires at the expense of eventual high-intensity
    fires that cause systemic collapse. \n\nAnd the SocGen episode was an example
    of the tendency we've seen from the Fed all through the last two decades, to use
    monetary policy as a blunt instrument to put every fire, no matter how minor."

  content: "David - you make some great points. Diversity is one of the most important
    determinants of resilience in a complex adaptive system. \n\nOne of the key concepts
    in the stability-resilience tradeoff is that stability reduces system resilience
    by reducing diversity in the system. Essentially,adaptation or natural selection
    in a constant environment will reduce diversity as only one strategy will \"win\".
    As a result, the very existence of variability in the environment increases diversity
    and promotes robustness. \n\nI'll explore these themes in more detail in a later
    post."

    In Ramachandran&#8217;s words, &#8220;At any given moment in our waking lives,
    our brains are flooded with a bewildering variety of sensory inputs, all of which
    have to be incorporated into a coherent perspective based on what stored memories
    already tell us is true about ourselves and the world. In order to act, the brain
    must have some way of selecting from this superabundance of detail and ordering
    it into a consistent &#8216;belief system&#8217;, a story that makes sense of
    the available evidence. When something doesn&#8217;t quite fit the script, however,
    you very rarely tear up the entire story and start from scratch. What you do,
    instead, is to deny or confabulate in order to make the information fit the big
    picture. Far from being maladaptive, such everyday defense mechanisms keep the
    brain from being hounded into directionless indecision by the &#8216;combinational
    explosion&#8217; of possible stories that might be written from the material available
    to the senses.&#8221; However, once a threshold is passed, the brain finds a way
    to revise the model completely. Ramachandran&#8217;s analysis also provides a
    neurological explanation for Thomas Kuhn&#8217;s phases of science where the &#8220;normal&#8221;

    further backing for the thesis that we follow simple rules and heuristics in the

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">This note examines the implications of adaptation by economic agents under Knightian uncertainty for the resilience of the macroeconomic system. It expands on themes I touched upon </span><a href="../2010/01/13/do-investors-prefer-negative-skewness/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> and </span><a href="../2009/12/06/minskys-financial-instability-hypothesis-and-hollings-conception-of-resilience-and-stability/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">. To summarise the key conclusions, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Under Knightian uncertainty, homo </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">economicus</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> is an irrelevant construct. The "optimal" course of action is one that restricts the choice of actions available and depends on a small set of simple rules and heuristics. </span></li>
<li style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">The choice of actions is restricted to those that are applicable in reasonably likely or recurrent situations. Actions applicable to rare situations are ignored. Therefore, it is entirely rational to take on severely negatively skewed bets. </span></li>
<li style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">By the same logic, economic agents find it harder to adapt to severe macroeconomic shocks as compared to mild shocks. This is the rationale for Axel Leijonhufvud's "Corridor Hypothesis". </span></li>
<li style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis states that prolonged periods of stability reduce the width of the "corridor" until the point where a macroeconomic crisis is inevitable. </span></li>
<li style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">The only assumptions needed to draw the above conclusions are the existence of uncertainty and sufficient adaptive/selective forces operating upon economic agents. </span></li>
<li style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Minksy</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> believed that this loss of resilience in the macroeconomic system is endogenous and inevitable. Although such a loss of resilience can arise endogenously, the evidence suggests that a significant proportion of the blame for the current crisis can be attributed to the stabilising policies favoured during the Great Moderation. </span></li>
<li style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Buzz Holling's work on ecosystem resilience has highlighted the peril of stabilising complex adaptive systems and how increased stability reduces system resilience. </span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Uncertainty and Negatively Skewed Payoffs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">In a previous </span><a href="../2010/01/13/do-investors-prefer-negative-skewness/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">note</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">, I explained how the existence of </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightian_uncertainty"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">Knightian uncertainty</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> leads to a perceived preference for severely negatively skewed payoffs. Ronald </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Heiner</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> explains exactly how this occurs in his seminal </span><a href="http://www.ww.uni-magdeburg.de/bizecon/material/heiner.1983.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">paper</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> on decision making under uncertainty. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Heiner</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> argues that in the presence of uncertainty, the "optimal" course of action is one that restricts the choice of actions available and depends on a small set of simple rules and heuristics. In his words, </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">" Think of an omniscient agent with literally no uncertainty in identifying the most preferred action under any conceivable condition, regardless of the complexity of the environment which he encounters. Intuitively, such an agent would benefit from maximum flexibility to use all potential information or to adjust to all environmental conditions, no matter how rare or subtle those conditions might be. But what if there is uncertainty because agents are unable to decipher all of the complexity of the environment? Will allowing complete flexibility still benefit the agents? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">I believe the general answer to this question is negative: that when genuine uncertainty exists, allowing greater flexibility to react to more information or administer a more complex repertoire of actions will not necessarily enhance an agent's performance. "</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">In Heiner's framework, actions chosen must satisfy a "Reliability Condition" which he summarises as: " </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">do so if the actual reliability in selecting the action exceeds the minimum required reliability necessary to improve performance. " </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">This required reliability cannot be achieved in the tails of the distribution and economic agents therefore ignore actions that are appropriate only in such situations. This explains our reluctance to insure against rare disasters which </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Heiner</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> notes: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">" Rare events are precisely those which are remote to a person's normal experience, so that uncertainty in detecting which rare disasters to insure against increases as p(probability of disaster) approaches zero. Such greater uncertainty will reduce the reliability of insurance decisions as disasters become increasingly remote to a person's normal experience."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">" At some point as p approaches zero, the Reliability Condition will be violated. This implies people will switch from typically buying to typically ignoring insurance conditions, which is just the pattern documented in </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">Kunreuther's</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> 1978 study."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Note the similarity between Heiner's analysis of tail risks under uncertainty and Kahneman and Tversky's </span><a href="../2010/01/13/do-investors-prefer-negative-skewness/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">distinction</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> between "possible" and "impossible" events. The reliability problem is also connected to the difficulty of ascertaining the properties of tail events through a statistical analysis of historical data. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">In an uncertainty-driven framework, it may be more appropriate to refer to this pattern as a reluctance to insure against tail risks rather than a preference for "blowup risks".</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> This distinction is also relevant in the moral hazard debate where the actions are often characterised better as a neglect of insurance of tail risks than an explicit taking on of such risks. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Impossible</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"> Events</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"> and Axel Leijonhufvud's "Corridor Hypothesis"</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Heiner</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> also extends this analysis of the reluctance to insure against "impossible" events to provide the rationale for Axel Leijonhufvud's </span><a href="http://www.econ.ucla.edu/workingpapers/wp027.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">"Corridor Hypothesis"</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> of macroeconomic shocks and recessions. In his words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"Now suppose, analogous to the insurance case, that there are different types of shocks. some more severe than others; where larger shocks are possible but less and less likely to happen. In addition, the reliability of detecting when and how to prepare for large shocks decreases as their determinants and repercussions are more remote to agents' normal experience. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">In a similar manner to that discussed for the insurance case, we can derive that the economy's structure will evolve so as to prepare for and react quickly to small shocks. However, outside of a certain zone or "corridor" around its long-run growth path, it will only very sluggishly react to sufficiently large, infrequent shocks." </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis and Leijonhufvud's Corridor</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Minsky's  Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH) asserts that stability breeds instability i.e. stability reduces the width of the corridor to the point where even a small shock is enough to push the system outside it.  Leijonhufvud acknowledged Minsky's insight that the width of the corridor was variable and depended upon the recency of past disturbances. In his own words: </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"Our theory implies a variable width of the corridor. Transactors who have once suffered through a displacement of unanticipated magnitude (on the order of the Great Depression, say) will be encouraged to maintain larger buffers thereafter-until the memory dims..."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">The assertion that stability breeds instability is well established in ecology, especially in Buzz Holling's work as I discussed </span><a href="../2009/12/06/minskys-financial-instability-hypothesis-and-hollings-conception-of-resilience-and-stability/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">. Heiner's framework explains Minsky's assertion as the logical consequence of agent adaptation under uncertainty. But the same can also be explained via "natural selection"-like mechanisms as well. The most relevant is the principal-agent relationship. Principals that "select" agents under asymmetric information can effectively mimic the effect of natural selection in ecosystems. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Minsky also argues that sooner or later, a capitalist economy will move outside this corridor due to entirely endogenous reasons. This is a more controversial assertion and can only be evaluated through a careful analysis of the empirical evidence. The assertion that an economy </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">can</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> move outside the corridor due to endogenous factors is difficult to reject. All it takes is a chance prolonged period of stability. However, this does not imply that the economy </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">must</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> move outside the corridor, which requires us to prove that prolonged periods of stability are the norm rather than the exception in a capitalist economy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis and C.S. Holling's conception of Resilience and Stability </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Minsky's idea that stability breeds instability is an important theme in the field of ecology. Buzz Holling however defined the problem as loss of resilience rather than instability. Resilience and stability are dramatically different concepts and Holling explained the difference in his seminal </span><a href="http://www.ivwl.uni-kassel.de/beckenbach/PDFs/aee0910/Holling_ResilStabilEcolSys.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">paper</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> on the topic as follows: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"Resilience determines the persistence of relationships within a system and is a measure of the ability of these systems to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and parameters, and still persist. In this definition resilience is the property of the system and persistence or probability of extinction is the result. Stability, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance. The more rapidly it returns, and with the least fluctuation, the more stable it is. In this definition stability is the property of the system and the degree of fluctuation around specific states the result."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">The relevant insight in Holling's work is that resilience and stability as goals for an ecosystem are frequently at odds with each other. In many ecosystems, </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"the very fact of low stability seems to produce high resilience</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">". Conversely, </span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"the goal of producing a maximum sustained yield may result in a more stable system of reduced resilience"</span><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">. Minsky's hypothesis is thus better described as "stability breeds loss of resilience", not "stability breeds instability". </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">The "Pathology of Natural Resource Management" is described by </span><a href="http://landscape.forest.wisc.edu/courses/Landscape565spr01/Holling_Meffe1996.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">Holling and </span></a><a href="http://landscape.forest.wisc.edu/courses/Landscape565spr01/Holling_Meffe1996.pdf"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">Meffe</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;"> as follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic;">"when the range of natural variation in a system is reduced, the system loses resilience.That is, a system in which natural levels of variation have been reduced through command-and-control activities will be less resilient than an unaltered system when subsequently faced with external perturbations."</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">Similarly, the dominant macroeconomic policy paradigm explicitly aims to stabilise the macroeconomy. In particular, monetary policy during the Great Moderation was used as a blunt instrument to put out all but the most minor macroeconomic fire. Stabilising policies of this nature can and do cause the same kind of loss of resilience that Minsky describes. Indeed, as I mentioned in my previous </span><a href="../2010/01/13/do-investors-prefer-negative-skewness/"><span style="color: #0034b0; font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: underline;">note</span></a><span style="font-family: Minion Pro; font-size: 12pt;">, agent adaptation to stabilising monetary and fiscal policies can be viewed as a more profound kind of moral hazard. Economic agents may take on severely negatively skewed bets not even as an adaptation to uncertainty but merely as a rational response to stabilising macroeconomic policies. </span></p>
