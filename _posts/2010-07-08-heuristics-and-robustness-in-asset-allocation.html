  content: You know, as I read this (linked from Infectious Greed), I could not help
    but think it equally well described the choice between fiscal austerity strategies
    (more robust, i.e., we know it's going to do one thing right and also especially
    in light of Rogoff/Reinhart work) and Keynesian stimulus strategies (more optimal
    if they work as predicted but much greater uncertainy and proponents similarly
    systematically overestimate probability of success, e.g., failure of Romer/Bernstein
    multiplier model to predict effect of 09 stimulus).

  content: Mark - you could make the argument that many macroeconomic paradigms based
    on Keynesian or Monetarist foundations make the mistake of overemphasizing optimality
    vs robustness.

<p>Harry Markowitz received  the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 for his work on mean-variance  optimisation that provided the foundations for<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory"> Modern Portfolio  Theory</a> (MPT). Yet as Gerd Gigerenzer<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YtbPmedzUgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=acqVXBwU98&amp;dq=rationality%20for%20mortals&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> notes</a>, when it came to  investing his own money, Markowitz relied on a simple heuristic, the  "1/N Rule" which simply allocates equally across all N funds under  consideration. At first glance, this may seem to be an incredibly  irrational strategy. Yet, <strong>there is compelling empirical evidence backing  even such a simple heuristic as the 1/N Rule</strong>. Gigerenzer points to a<a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cluster=14000504559249677688&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2000"> study</a> conducted by  DeMiguel, Garlappi and Uppal (DMU) which after comparing many  asset-allocation strategies including Markowitz mean-variance  optimisation concludes that <em>"there is no single model that consistently  delivers a Sharpe ratio or a CEQ return that is higher than that of the  1/ N portfolio, which also has a very low turnover."</em></p>
<p>Before exploring  exactly what the DMU study and Gigerenzer's work implies, it is worth  emphasizing what it does not imply. First, as both DMU and Gigerenzer  stress, the purpose of this post is not to argue for the superiority of  the 1/N Rule over all other asset-allocation strategies. The aim is just  to illustrate how <strong>simple heuristics can outperform apparently complex  optimisation strategies under certain circumstances.</strong> Second, the 1/N  Rule does not apply when allocating across securities with excessive<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp"> idiosyncratic  risk</a> e.g. single stocks. In the DMU study for example, the N assets are  equity portfolios constructed on the basis of industry classification,  countries, firm characteristics etc.</p>
<p>So in what circumstances does the 1/N  Rule outperform? Gigerenzer provides a few answers<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YtbPmedzUgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=acqVXCwTa7&amp;dq=rationality%20for%20mortals&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> here</a> as do DMU in the  above-mentioned<a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cluster=14000504559249677688&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2000"> study</a> but in my opinion,  all of them come down to <em>"the predictive uncertainty of the problem</em>". <strong>When faced with  significant irreducible uncertainty, the robustness of the approach is  more relevant to its future performance than its optimality.</strong> As  Gigerenzer notes, this is not about computational intractability -  indeed, a more uncertain environment requires a simpler approach, not a  more complex one. In his words: <em>"The optimization models performed better  than the simple heuristic in data fitting but worse in predicting the  future."</em></p>
<p>Again, it's worth  reiterating that both studies do not imply that we should abandon all  attempts at asset allocation - the DMU study essentially evaluates the  1/N Rule and all other strategies based on their risk-adjusted returns  as defined under MPT i.e. by their<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio"> Sharpe Ratio</a>. Given that most  active asset management implies a certain absence of faith in the  canonical assumptions underlying MPT, some strategies could outperform  if evaluated differently. Nevertheless, the fundamental conclusion  regarding the importance of a robust approach holds and a robust asset  allocation can be achieved in other ways. For example, when allocating  across 20 asset categories, any preferred asset-allocation algorithm  could be used with a constraint that the maximum allocation to any  category cannot exceed 10%. <strong>Such "hard limits" are commonly used by fund  managers and although they may not have any justifying  rationale under MPT, this does not mean that they are "irrational".</strong></p>
<p><strong>The need to increase  robustness over optimisation when faced with uncertainty is also one of  the reasons why the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"> Kelly Criterion</a> is so often  implemented in practise as a "Fractional Kelly" strategy.</strong> The Kelly  Criterion is used to determine the optimal size of sequential  bets/investments that maximises the expected growth rate of the  portfolio. It depends crucially upon the estimate of the "edge" that the  trader possesses. In an uncertain environment,  this estimate is less reliable and as Ed Thorp explains<a href="http://www.edwardothorp.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/KellyCriterion2007.pdf"> here</a>, the edge will most  likely be overestimated. In Ed Thorp's words: <em>"Estimates....in the  stock market have many uncertainties and, in cases of forecast excess  return, are more likely to be too high than too low. The tendency is to  regress towards the mean....The economic situation can change for  companies, industries, or the economy as a whole. Systems that worked  may be partly or entirely based on data mining....Systems that do work  attract capital, which tends to push exceptional [edge] down towards  average values."</em></p>
