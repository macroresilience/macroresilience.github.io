  content: "Michael - Thanks for that. My point was to argue for a \"qui tam\"-like
    incentive that extends beyond just those actions that constitute fraud against
    the government and extend also to those actions that are fraudulent against the
    organisation itself i.e. equityholders and creditors. Such an incentive could
    be paid out by the organisation itself. \n\nBut I'm no lawyer and this is just
    a speculative idea. What I am certain about is that most financial frauds can
    only be caught by insiders. Even the most informed regulator is unlikely to catch
    fraud in some of the more complex banking functions."

    caught for fraud at processing level, management covering it up/ making it go

    whistle isnt worth the trouble it brings as you exhale into the whistle"

Much ink has been spilt on improving the regulatory framework to avoid another </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lehman</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (See for example </span></span><a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2010/03/poachers-turned-gamekeepers.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">TED</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">). Improving the incentives for employee whistleblowers to come forward is an important regulatory imperative that has not received the attention that it deserves. All whistleblowers, not just employees, play a key role in uncovering fraud in corporations. The bulk of this post is derived from the excellent work done in this regard by </span></span><a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/luigi.zingales/research/papers/whistle.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dyck</span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/luigi.zingales/research/papers/whistle.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, Morse and Zingales</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(henceforth DMZ) and </span></span><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rajgopal/public_html/files/BCR_sep14_jaaf.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bowen, Call and </span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rajgopal/public_html/files/BCR_sep14_jaaf.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rajgopal</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Compared to other whistleblowers, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">employees have the best access to the information required to uncover fraud. They also possess the knowledge to analyse and parse the information for any signs of fraud. T</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">his is especially important in a field such as banking where outsiders rarely possess the knowledge to uncover fraud even when they possess the raw information - a key reason why the media is so ineffective in uncovering banking fraud compared to its role in other industries which DMZ highlight. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One might ask why auditors are so ineffective in uncovering fraud despite possessing the relevant information. One reason is the aforementioned lack of knowledge required to uncover fraud in complex situations. But a more crucial reason is that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">auditors are </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">incentivised</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to ignore fraud.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> In </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">DMZ's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> words:</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "we find a clear cost for auditors who blow the whistle. The auditor of a company involved with fraud is more likely to lose the client if he blows the whistle than if he does not, while there is no significant evidence that bringing the fraud to light pays him off in terms of a greater number of accounts."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So what prevents more employee whistleblowers from coming forward? As DMZ note, many whistleblowers prefer to remain anonymous because : </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"In spite of being selected cases (for which the expected benefit of revealing should exceed the expected cost), we find that in 82 percent of cases, the </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whistleblower</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was fired, quit under duress, or had significantly altered responsibilities. In addition, many employee whistleblowers report having to move to another industry and often to another town to escape personal harassment. The lawyer of James </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bingham</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, a </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whistleblower</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in the Xerox case, sums up Jim’s situation as: "Jim had a great career, but he'll never get a job in Corporate America again."</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">..... </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">consequences to being the </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whistleblower</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> include distancing and retaliation from fellow workers and friends, personal attacks on one’s character during the course of a protracted dispute, and the need to change one’s career. Not only is the honest behavior not rewarded by the market, but it is penalized.</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">" i.e.</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> employers prefer loyal employees to honest ones, just as they prefer loyal auditors to honest auditors. </span></strong></span></p>

Under the </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whistleblower</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> provisions of SOX, employees who disclose improper financial practices receive greater protection from discrimination. (See title 18 U.S.C., § 1514A(a)(1).) SOX also ruled that every company quoted on a U.S. Stock Exchange must set up a </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">hotline</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> enabling whistle-blowers to report anonymously (Economist 2006)." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">DMZ offer many possible explanations for why these provisions have not succeeded:</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "One possible explanation is that rules which strengthen the protection of the whistleblowers’ current jobs offer only a small reward relative to the extensive ostracism whistleblowers face. Additionally, just because jobs are protected does not mean that career advancements in the firm are not impacted by whistle blowing. Another explanation could be that job protection is of no use if the firm goes bankrupt after the revelation of fraud."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So what else can be done to encourage employees to come forward? Unsurprisingly, DMZ find that monetary incentives have a role to play and I agree. Employee whistleblowers play a more significant role in industries such as healthcare where </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"</span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Qui</span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> tam"</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> suits are available. I would assert that monetary incentives have an even stronger role to play in uncovering fraud in banking. The extremely high lifetime pay expected in the course of a banking career combined with the almost certainly career-ending implications of becoming a </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whistleblower</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> means that any employee will think twice before pulling the trigger. Moreover, the extremely specialised nature of the industry means that many senior bankers have very few alternative industries to move to. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The focus of SOX on making it harder to fire whistleblowers is misguided as well as ineffective. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The focus must be not to keep whistleblowers from losing their jobs but to compensate them sufficiently so that they never have to work again. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As it happens, the scale of fraud in financial institutions means that this may even be achieved without spending taxpayer money. The </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whistleblower</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> may be allowed to claim a small percentage of the monetary value of the fraud prevented from the institution itself, which should be more than sufficient for the purpose. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The obvious objection to my proposal is that this will lead to a surge in frivolous claims from disgruntled employees. For one, the monetary reward is dependent on fraud being proven in a court of law and the likely career-ending nature of becoming a </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whistleblower</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> should be enough to prevent any frivolous allegations. Indeed, DMZ find that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the percentage of frivolous lawsuits is lower in the healthcare industry where "</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">qui</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> tam" suits are available. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As DMZ point out, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"the idea of extending the </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">qui</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> tam statue to corporate frauds (i.e. providing a financial award to those who bring forward information about a corporate fraud) is very much in the </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hayekian</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> spirit of sharpening the incentives of those who are endowed with information." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is even more crucial in uncovering fraud in a complex industry such as banking where even qualified outsiders may struggle to put the pieces together and informed insiders face such steep deterrents that prevent them from rocking the boat. </span></span></p>
