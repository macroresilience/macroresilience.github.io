  content: Might I suggest that this also applies to Intellectual Property "protection"?
    Certainly the competition problem is more difficult, because foreign companies
    might be able to work more cheaply, but other than that IP is just as bad for
    innovation (and might actually be one of the reasons why banks will become more
    unwilling over time to lend money to newcomers, because they feel they don't stand
    a chance).

  content: "This is a good article delineating the costs of corruption relative to
    the competitive dynamics at various levels of an economy.  The competitive internal
    dynamics, intra-industry and how they facilitate economic advancement and innovation
    are deeply unexplored in economics.  \n\nMost economists and analysts just look
    at the economy as a simple set of interlocking pieces instead of each economy
    as slightly different set of competitive ecological niches behaving with differing
    rules to deliver or not deliver the goods.\n\nThe argument you put forward is
    good and addresses structural variation and adapted behaviors.  Most policy and
    economic debate assumes that finding the right interest rate policy or some other
    crude lever will solve all problems.\n\nThis present a crude mechanistic treatment
    of economy like a machine that overheats or cools down relative to \"money\" fuel
    running through it.\n\nPoor Structural dynamics and competitive behaviors hurt
    Japan leading to stagnant growth.  Rate policy, \"missing demand\", demographics
    etc. most likely have less to do with the \"lost\" decades, than poor competitive
    structures allowing for innovation and creative destruction."

  content: Why the Japan bashing, they run a nice external surplus, so how they choose
    to manage their internal affairs is nobody else's business. I would point out
    that the life expectancy gap is now 4yrs between Japan &amp; the US (and in yrs
    of healthy life even larger), might not be a great place to be a capitalist but
    hardly a hellhole

    - Thanks. I agree - deflation or inflation are not the source of all our ailments!\n\nTim
    - I apologise if this comes across as Japan bashing and I certainly am not arguing
    that Japan is somehow worse off than the US. But they could certainly do a lot
    better if the cronyism in their domestic sectors is tackled. I strongly recommend
    reading Richard Katz on this subject - if anything he is more optimistic on Japan
    than most commentators are (as am I)."

  content: "I found this portion of the argument deeply unsatisfying, and the use
    of Japan as an example did not help.  Every economy has embedded social relationships
    -- in an efficient capitalist market economy, people behave \"as if\" they were
    dealing with one another anonymously, but, of course, they are not.\n\nProductivity
    is mostly a matter of \"technical\" (back in the day, sometimes called x-efficiency)
    efficiency, and not the allocative efficiency, on which economists traditionally
    focus.  \"Technical\" efficiency concerns management, formal organization, tacit
    knowledge, engineering, etc.  Innovation, in the Schumpeterian sense, is mostly
    about how the changes in allocational efficiency that follow from applying technical
    or managerial change can be exploited by entrepreneurs.\n\nA putative Entrepreneur
    sees the technical possibility of producing widgets in a new, more productive
    way.  Because resources are priced at marginal product associated with old ways
    of doing things, entrepreneur is able to bid away resources for his new way, apply
    them in the new way, and reap a large, albeit possibly transitory gain -- the
    difference between the cost of resources priced by the productivity of the old
    way, and the actual productivity realized in the new way.  Productivity improvements
    are increasing the cost of factor resources even as they reduce the cost of final
    product.  Edison expressed the basic Schumpeterian idea, when he asserted that
    the light bulb would make candles into luxuries.\n\nThere are issues, here, preliminary
    to any consideration of finance and crony-ism.\n\nOne is the purely allocational
    one: does an innovating industry attract resources?  \n\nA simple-minded, naive
    analysis might suggest that an innovative industry would be reducing costs, and
    therefore be profitable and would expand, taking in resources (e.g. hiring labor,
    renting land) from obsolete, and therefore shrinking industry.  \n\nA few minutes
    thought would suggest that elasticities, not to mention market and political power,
    would matter a lot to the shape of the scenario.  Productivity could rise, but
    by more than demand expanded, and the result would be a shedding of resources,
    not growth.  Prices of product could fall, and by enough that the rise in \"real\"
    productivity could translate into falling marginal product (e.g. wages), a seemingly
    perverse result that would repel resources from a productivity-enhancing application.\n\nA
    second issue arises from substitution-bias of technical change.  Productivity-enhancing
    technological innovation almost always involves sunk-cost investments, to realize
    the technical efficiency gain.  There are two critically important implications.\n\nFirst,
    the association of sunk-cost investments with productivity-enhancing innovation
    means that such innovation tends to be orthogonal to any allocational factor substitution.
    \ Technical innovation is a vector perpendicular to, and independent of, the rate
    of factor substitution along any counterfactual production possibilities frontier.\n\nTechnical
    innovation is embedded in the sunk-cost capital investment, including dedicated
    capital equipment, and gains in total factor productivity mean that, measured
    against a unit of output, innovation tends to result in ex-post methods of production,
    which are less labor-intensive AND less-capital-intensive.  (Economists, in particular,
    steeped as they are in substitution and allocational efficiency, tend not to 'get
    this' aspect of innovation; naive economists will recommend to developing countries
    that they play to their comparative advantage, and so some advised Japan, for
    example, to promote \"labor-intensive\" sectors after WWII, since Japan had overpopulation
    and little natural resource or financial capital claims.)  In general, technical
    innovations depend for their key economies on control of error and waste.  Enhanced
    control in the organization of production typically limits the options for \"labor-substitution\"
    so dear to economists; there's only one seat on the farm tractor.\n\nSecond, the
    sunk-cost nature of the investment, which is the core of Schumpeterian innovation,
    creates a potential uncertainty challenge for financing innovation.  Sunk-cost
    investment implies a inherent handicap on post-investment bargaining over product
    price; the cost of the sunk-cost invesment will simply not be a consideration
    for the rational entrepreneur or his customers in the market negotiation.  The
    ability to earn a return on the sunk-cost investment (and, therefore, to repay
    its financing) depends on some form of \"irrational\" market power (\"irrational\"
    in the sense that it is always irrational to take into consideration sunk-costs
    in ex-post decision-making; sunk costs are sunk and no longer a consideration
    for a rational, maximizing agent).  \n\nIndustrial Organization quickly skips
    down the path to rents, or quasi-rents, from barriers to entry, first-mover advantages,
    etc., but I just want to draw your attention to the fundamental, and quite general,
    challenge that productivity-enhancing sunk-cost investment poses to finance.\n\nIt
    is not obvious that there are good, general solutions to this fundamental problem.
    \ Purely artificial contrivances, like intellectual property, are inherently counterproductive.
    \ If an \"idea\" (representing a sunk-cost investment in thinking or research)
    is free to communicate, then to maximize its usefulness, it should be free to
    use.  If you charge for its use in an innovative application, it is equivalent
    to taxing the innovation -- there's a potential dead-weight loss.\n\nReal business
    entrepreneurs, pursuing innovation, must be vitally concerned with their \"business
    model\", i.e. their theory about how a return can be earned on a sunk-cost investment,
    which is likely to affect both factor costs and final product price.  The solution
    always turns on economic rents, though not necessarily in the purely pejorative
    sense conveyed by Mancur Olson.  \n\nAll businesses in an uncertain world, where
    sunk-cost investment is the universal requirement for threshold efficiency, are
    rent-seekers.  They have to be; \"profit-maximizing\" is an undefined term in
    a world of genuine uncertainty.  The control of rent-earning factors are what
    give firms stability.  The ability of large firms to develop and field bureaucratic
    organizations depends on business models, which secure large rents;  it is the
    margin of the factor rent, which allows the firm to be a reliable nexus of contracts,
    and cope with uncertainty in the Knightian sense.  It is the existence of factor
    rents, and quasi-rents on sunk-cost capital investments, which gives the economy
    a structure and a sense of institutional permanence.\n\nSorry for the long lecture
    -- I don't doubt that you know all of this, but I want to establish a neutral
    language and tone, before asserting that cyclical context might be key.\n\nIn
    particular, I want to focus attention on the interaction of the elasticity problem
    and the sunk-cost investment problem.\n\nOrdinarily, productivity-enhancing investment
    in innovation will not be a simple morality tale of virtue rewarded.  The invisible
    hand may well shove the innovator onto a treadmill; declining product prices drag
    down the financial value of increasing factor marginal product.  Productivity
    growth can be so rapid in a sector that the sector must shrink in factor-input
    terms.  The perverse incidence of a market economy means that the returns to innovation
    flow not to the innovator, but to the non-innovating laggard.  Classically, this
    is the land-owner, earning an enhanced rent from rising labor productivity or
    public investments in better transporation systems.\n\nThese problems of adjustment
    are not necessarily smoothly solved.  Economies can get stuck in a cul de sac,
    where forward progress requires a re-distribution of income and rents, to which
    incumbent rentiers are reluctant to consent.\n\nFor the U.S., the Great Depression
    presented several such problems.  One was in electrical utility and power generation.
    \ The efficient and productivity-enhancing path involved huge investments in additional
    power generation and wider distribution, and equally huge reductions in rates.
    \ That was not a path that private utilities were eager to embrace, for obvious
    reasons.\n\nThe most significant for the U.S. in the 1920s was in agriculture.
    \ Up until the closing of the frontier, agriculture was expanding, taking in new
    resources.  The returns to new farmers and new farmland were sufficient to drive
    the expansive development of the continent.  But, at some point between 1890 and
    1930, productivity-enhancing innovations were reducing the resources necessary
    to produce what was demanded.  The WWI boom disguised this for a time, making
    the experience of the 1920s that much more intense.  Self-defeating contradictions
    took over.  Cycles of overproduction made farm incomes not just lower, but far
    riskier and more volatile, frustrating the ability of farmers to finance either
    the new innovative investments or out-migration.  The second AAA (agricultural
    adjustment act) scheme -- the first one failed and was declared unconstitutional
    to boot, as I recall) -- established a scheme that successfully managed the income
    risks, in a way that promoted both out-migration of resources and high-rates of
    investment (a neat trick, when you think about it -- in and out, simultaneously).
    \ Productivity, measured in output per acre, began to rise markedly in 1935 for
    all major crops, and continued to rise for decades.  \n\nJapan, I think, got caught
    in a similar cul-de-sac, associated with rising productivity in manufacturing.
    \ Manufacturing across the developed world is at a stage, where it expands in
    physical output, but shrinks in input.  It happened in Japan early and acutely,
    because the Japanese economy is so intensely dependent on industrial manufacturing.
    \ But, it is surely part of the reality on the ground in Michigan and Ohio, as
    well.\n\nThe Last Temptation of Finance is to disguise a return on disinvestment
    as a return on investment."

    Many of the domestic sectors are characterised by tariff/implicit cartel-like

    Richard Katz on this subject who refers to this phenomenon as the \"dual economy\"

    not opposed to the Schumpeterian story of temporary rents as the incentive for

    mechanisms and cause stagnation/collapse. \n\nOn the subject of rising productivity
    leading to falling output, one industry may shrink but till now capitalist economies
    have found other things to produce and consume via \"exploratory\" investment.

  content: "Again, I apologize for my long lecture, above.  It was more for me, than
    you.\n\nThe implication for Japan is that there's a relationship between the high
    productivity, export industries and the low-productivity domestic sectors, and
    it lies in the development strategy adopted in the 1950s, which has now played
    out, exhausting its potential for forward-movement.  Japan is in a macroeconomic
    cul-de-sac, with microeconomic foundations (to coin a phrase), and with no way
    easy way out, politically.\n\nI think Krugman and Koo and the rest do Japan a
    bit of a disservice, when they abstract the macro-financial aspects of Japan's
    situation, and ignore the extent to which Japan's economic structure was set in
    place by a more-or-less deliberate and highly successful development strategy,
    which rested on BOTH a highly efficient export sector and some highly-inefficient
    domestic sectors (especially agriculture and service industries), not to mention
    absurdly high rates of financial saving by households.  I'm not objecting to Katz
    detailing the reality of the outcome of that development strategy run aground.\n\nNor
    am I asserting a philistine \"lump of labor\" fallacy.  What I am asserting is
    that macroeconomic phenomena rest on a microfoundation of a dynamic economy, where
    technical efficiency dominates allocational efficiency, and the free substitution
    of labor for capital, or vice-versa, is not a feasible option.  The \"lumpiness\"
    is in the technology-embedding capital stock.\n\nKeynes envisioned an economy
    in which it is possible for some people to literally fall out of the circular
    flow, and have no feasible way to get back in.  The classical model asserts that
    labor and capital can be smoothly substituted, and that, therefore, excluded resources
    can bid their way back into the circular flow, by driving down prices, to wit,
    wages; deflation can cure a depression.  Experience suggests deflation exacerbates
    depression; I'll leave the financial aspects of that -- debt deflation, etc. --
    to others.\n\nWhat I am trying to draw your attention to, behind the organizing
    role of rents, is the sunk-cost investment in capital stock, and the political
    contest, not just over rents, but over the division of income between Labor and
    Capital.  The technology-embedding sunk-cost nature of productivity increasing
    investment is a signficant micro constraint on macro possibilities.  \n\nThat
    constraint can be experienced as \"lumpiness\" and there are significant economic
    problems involved that do not lend themselves easily to solution on first-best,
    panglossian terms.  In the U.S. Great Depression, a significant problem centered
    on wages in highly productive industrial processing industries, where mass-production
    technologies were advancing very rapidly.  Wages had to rise, despite significant
    de-skilling and massive macro unemployment, for the economy to arrive at a prosperous
    equilibrium.  And, wages in industrial manufacturing did rise, due to the promotion
    of industrial unionism.  (Paradoxically, only a rising labor share in income could
    drive the necessary capital investment; a rising income share for capital could
    have been achieved only by reduced capital investment.)  \n\nIn general, I think
    income distribution is driven by risk distribution and the availability of insurance
    (and, of course, associated political power, but I think in terms of economics,
    first, politics, second).  Rents are the \"real\" economy foundation of insurance,
    which is, of course, a monetary institution, and the incentive structure of the
    micro economy.  It's because I have this view of the \"real\" microfoundations
    of macro, that I really admire what you are trying to do here, on your blog.  I
    find it stimulating.  If I seem deaf or dense, I apologize; unrequited love needs
    to irritate the beloved.  ;-)  \n\nHope you have a great holiday."

  content: "On Japan, I couldn't agree more. The current malaise is deeply connected
    to the strategy they followed post WW2. The conventional diagnosis that creating
    inflation will cure the problem is naive and wrong. Most economists underestimate
    just how hard it is to execute dramatic U-turns in economic strategy without causing
    serious disruptions. I think China will face the same problem as Japan did 20
    years ago in successfully shifting away from its current strategy. \n\nOn income
    distribution, I don't disagree that in a nth best world, things like unionism
    can be a force for the good. What I've been trying to investigate is whether a
    transfer of income to labour can be achieved in a more organic manner - hence
    my writings on the role of exploration/new entry in forcing increased investment
    and reduced profit, cash etc on the incumbent firms. \n\nThe blog is just my way

  content: On the wider point, I think this argument would be much improved if it
    could make a distinction between crony capitalism and industrial policy (especially
    in developing countries). Precisely because there is a large grey area in between.
    It is hard to argue that industrial policy has not been helpful in some cases
    (e.g. the Asian Tigers, or even Japan post WW2).

    it almost certainly was better to follow an industrial policy that would eventually
    lead to economic stagnation after becoming rich than it is to remain poor. \n\nI'm
    more optimistic about Japan than this post hints at - I think they're close to
    the end of this stagnation. On the other hand, China may be just entering the
    beginning of their cronyist stagnationist phase."

  content: Thanks for your reply, which I certainly agree with. Maybe the problem
    in designing an industrial policy is to avoid its capture by already entrenched
    crony interests, which would tend to negate its exploratory potential. After all,
    if the only problem is that the policy ultimately leads to well-established sectors
    with associated cronyism, then on its original terms it has already succeeded,
    but targeted subsidies have been allowed to become mere rents.

Although I drew parallels with the experiences with cronyism in developing economies, there are some important differences that I neglected to mention.</p>
<p><strong>Financing Constraints and Cronyism</strong></p>
<p><a href="/2010/09/08/cyclical-vs-structural-unemployment-and-uncertainty/">Earlier</a>, I highlighted the role that financing constraints faced by new firms can play in inhibiting exploratory investment. As Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales have <a href="http://www.savingcapitalism.com/">explained</a> in great detail, <strong>financing constraints have caused and helped support cronyism throughout economic history.</strong> Incumbent corporates feel especially threatened by free financial markets <em>"because they provide resources to newcomers, who then can make other markets competitive."</em></p>
<p>Banks may be reluctant to lend to new entrants for entirely rational reasons such as lack of collateral or uncertainty-aversion. Moreover, many developing economies are capital-poor at the early stages of their economic development and their governments often choose to play an active part in allocating scarce capital to chosen industries and firms. In his book on the origins of cronyism in Japan, <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8GCAEj2P7SYC">Richard Katz</a> laid out the extent to which Japanese capital-intensive firms were dependent upon state patronage and approval for their financing needs in the 50s and 60s. Katz takes the example of Kawasaki Steel which struggled to raise capital for Japan's first modern integrated steel facility due to the objections of the BoJ and only succeeded due to the patronage of another government agency, the Japan Development bank (JDB).</p>
<p><strong>Inefficient Crony Capitalism vs Efficient Crony Capitalism</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Although there are some similarities (e.g. collateral constraints), it is a stretch to compare the cronyism of capital-poor developing economies with financing constraints faced by new firms in the developed world (especially the United States) today. There are fundamental differences between the crony capitalism faced by the United States and the experience of economies such as India or Japan. As I have highlighted <a href="/2010/11/24/the-cause-and-impact-of-crony-capitalism-the-great-stagnation-and-the-great-recession/">before</a>, <strong>our malaise is caused by insufficiently exploratory incumbent firms. </strong>However, our economy is sufficiently internally competitive that incumbent corporates are efficient. Crony capitalism in most developing economies and in Japan has been characterised by a distinctly inefficient and uncompetitive corporate sector. <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8GCAEj2P7SYC">Katz</a> describes the high costs and overemployment that are endemic to many of Japan's domestic industries which can only remain solvent due to a myriad of implicit and explicit collusive and protectionist measures. In other words, <strong>the protected incumbents in most developing economies not only fail to explore but are exploitatively inefficient.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The exploitatively inefficient crony capitalism of most developing economies is easy to identify. </strong>For example, Katz documents the abysmal productivity of Japan's protected domestic sectors. On the other hand, <strong>a systemic failure to explore and innovate is more subtle and harder to detect - in fact, the drive towards exploitative efficiency is likely to increase measured productivity in the short run.</strong> When Katz <a href="http://www.viet-studies.info/kinhte/Japan_fallacy_FA.htm">argues</a> that America's problems have few similarities to the problems of Japan's dual economy he is only half right.</p>
<p>The most significant difference between inefficient and efficient crony capitalism is in its impact on unemployment and prices.<strong> Paradoxically, efficient crony capitalism goes hand in hand with higher unemployment and lower prices. </strong>Incumbent corporates are efficient enough to shed workers during the inevitable deleveraging cycle but are unwilling to explore and create the new jobs that will take their place. Intense exploitative competition between the incumbents also reduces price levels in the short run. On the other hand, <strong>inefficient crony economies have lower unemployment at the cost of lower economic output and higher prices.</strong> Richard Katz's observations on Japan's hidden social safety net are worth repeating in full: <em>"Whereas in Europe, the social safety net is woven out of overt government programs, in Japan it occurs in hidden form. Anticompetitive activities allow moribund companies and flagging companies to sustain themselves so that unemployment is disguised...."Japan is organized so that society's losers don't feel like losers," is how it is described by Takashi Kiuchi, chief economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank."</em></p>
