  content: Do you have a post somewhere explaining how to credibly remove the public
    protection provided to the banking sector?  I don't see a way absent a constitutional
    amendment.  Also, what do you mean by "in a time-consistent manner"?

  content: "\"Time consistency\" is just academic jargon to say that the promise not
    to protect the banks must be credible. The regulator can always say that he will
    not intervene but when push comes to shove, he will be tempted to do so. In order
    to avoid this, he has to tie his own hands up in some manner. \n\nOn how to remove
    the protection, that is the golden question and I don't have a post on any solutions.
    Clearly deposit insurance needs to be removed but more importantly a significant
    proportion of debt in banks needs to be contingent capital, if not all debt. But
    the exact details of such a contingent capital system are tricky to figure out
    and more importantly, any transition needs some wholesale amendments to past contracts."

  content: My favored way of removing deposit protection is to raise FDIC premiums
    high enough that some banks begin to drop out of the FDIC.  I would have the secondary
    impact that it would bail out the hole in the FDIC's balance sheet.

  content: David - That's an idea I can definitely support! The harder part in my
    view is how we go about removing the implicit protection to other bank creditors
    post Lehman, and even more tricky is the moral hazard created by the Greenspan
    put variant of monetary policy which tries to bail out all asset prices in times
    of stress.

    The issue you raise is a good one.

    Another strategy would be to ban securitization. That way, the person doing the credit analysis would also hold the credit risk. Ratings agencies don't care if the are right or wrong -- they get paid either way. The lender does not care if the loan will be paid back, so long as he can securitize the loan and get it off his book.

    In mortgage market, for example, there was no securitization in 1950s and yet, somehow, the US was able to produce plenty of houses for all, actually more than in recent boom I believe. So why bother with this at all?

    Deposit insurance is the one thing in the banking system that actually almost works correctly, and even it is badly implemented as it should be infinite. Removing it is terrible idea.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Franken</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Amendment draws upon Richardson and White's  idea of a centralised clearing platform which I  had criticised </span></span><a href="../2010/04/27/ratings-reform-the-centralised-clearing-platform-proposal/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">earlier</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. This proposal is based upon a flawed  understanding of the structured products' ratings process and the  incentives guiding the agencies during this process and arises from a  false extrapolation of the corporate and sovereign bond ratings process  into the realm of structured products. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The fatal flaw in our ratings regime  is not the issuer-pays model but the fact that ratings agencies only get paid  if the bond is issued.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> In the structured products space, the difference between a potential AAA  rating and a AA rating is not just that a higher spread is paid to the  investor on the bond. The lower rating usually means that the bond will  not be issued at all, which means that the ratings agency will not earn any fees. This  problem cannot be solved even if we have a single monopolistic ratings  agency paid by the SEC, so long as the fees are payable only upon  issuance of the bond. As I have discussed </span></span><a href="../2010/04/27/ratings-reform-the-centralised-clearing-platform-proposal/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">earlier</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in more detail,</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> ratings agencies are </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">incentivised</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> not only to expand market share  but to expand the size of the market for rateable securities. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let me explain the  logic with a simple example. A pension fund approaches a bank for a  bespoke AAA tranche on a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. The  bank constructs an appropriate tranche paying </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Libor</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> + 100 bps and asks for a rating, upon which the  clearing platform allocates it an agency. The agency comes back with a  AA rating instead - so what does the bank do in this instance? It cannot  change the </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tranching</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> without damaging its own economics  and the client will not accept a AA tranche paying the same coupon. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So the deal just does not get done  and the ratings agency is left without any fee for its opinion. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let us go a little further along this  chain of thought - all competing agencies are similarly stringent in  their ratings and discover after six months that their earnings and </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">dealflow</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> have collapsed! At this point, they  will of course gradually start easing their ratings requirements and  sooner or later we will end up in the same position we were in before  the crisis hit us. Its worth noting that this outcome does not change if someone other than the issuer pays the agency or even if we have  a monopolistic ratings agency. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Provided that the agency is a profit-maximising entity, the  removal of direct competition may slow the process of easing of ratings  criteria, but it will not change the end result. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In fact, the above  example is too generous as it ignores the ease with which the  centralised platform process can be gamed by banks. The central problem  here is the fact that there are a multitude number of structured bonds  that can </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">fulfill</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> a typical client request, such as the  one above. For example, let us assume that the bank above constructs a  tranche from a portfolio of MBS and applies to the platform which  allocates it to </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moody's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. If Moody's comes back with an  unsatisfactory rating, it cancels the issuance, makes a small  modification to the portfolio and </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tranching</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and tries its luck again. The process can continue until the bank gets allocated to a more friendly ratings agency and the desired  rating is achieved. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The  fundamental issue here is that tinkering with the system in this manner  is futile - the problems inherent in our current financial system are  too fundamental and we have only two choices as I hinted at in an  earlier </span></span><a href="../2009/12/05/regulatory-arbitrage-and-the-efficiency-resilience-tradeoff/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">post</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We can either put in place blunt and almost  certainly efficiency-reducing regulations or we can move towards a  free-market system where the implicit and explicit protection provided  to the banking sector is removed in a credible and time-consistent  manner.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> To give  you a simple example of a blunt regulation that will reduce the  potential for ratings arbitrage, we could legislate that if a portfolio  of sub investment-grade assets cannot be </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tranched</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to produce a AAA tranche. The price we  pay for such regulations is that we eliminate a significant proportion  of legitimate </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tranching</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, but this trade-off is unavoidable. </span></span></p>
