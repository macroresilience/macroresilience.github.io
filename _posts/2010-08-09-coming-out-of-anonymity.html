  content: Jeremy - Thanks! It's in the investments space - would rather not say too
    much before we've executed something concrete which will hopefully be by the end
    of the year.

<p>I recently exited banking to start work on an entrepreneurial venture I've been excited about for a while which means that I have updated my <a href="/about/">"About"</a> page. The most rewarding aspect of writing on this blog has been the feedback that I've received. Hopefully, my "unanonymisation" will encourage some of you who are uncomfortable with the idea of engaging with an anonymous person to converse with me. Thanks for reading.</p>
