<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman's</span></span> <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/press/press-releases/current/sec-response.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">rebuttal</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of the SEC lawsuit raises some  specific points that deserve further analysis. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></em></span><em> </em><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sachs</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Lost Money On The Transaction."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Whether </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> made money or not would have been  relevant if they were just an investor like IKB. However </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> is not just an investor, it is a  market-maker. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Whether  a market-maker loses or makes money on a specific trade with a client  is irrelevant. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The  market-maker's role is to tailor the product desired by the client and  hedge out the residual risk with other </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">counterparties</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in the market. The ultimate loss or profit on one trade is  irrelevant unless considered in the context of the exposures of the  trading book as a whole. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In this particular case, the residual equity exposure could  have been left </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">unhedged</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> because it was a natural hedge to  other positions in the book. Else, it could have been dynamically  delta-hedged in the market via CDS on the underlying. Or it could have  been macro-hedged via a short position on an index. The point is that  analysing the profit or loss on an isolated trade in the book of a  market-maker is meaningless. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Extensive Disclosure Was Provided.....These investors also  understood that a synthetic CDO transaction necessarily included both a  long and short side."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> strongest rebuttal as sufficient disclosure on the asset pool was  likely provided. Moreover, the argument that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> does not have to disclose that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> is on the short side is even stronger  than most commentators realise. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">From the perspective of Abacus as a legal entity, the short  side is </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> itself. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> is only </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman's</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> hedge against their exposure  arising from Abacus. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is clear from slide 50 in the </span></span><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/30036962/Abacus-2007-Ac1-Flipbook-20070226"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Abacus </span></span></span></span></a><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/30036962/Abacus-2007-Ac1-Flipbook-20070226"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">pitchbook</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> which represents </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> as the "Protection Buyer". </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What is unusual however is that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was short the tranches themselves  rather than the underlying bonds. From </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> perspective, this makes sense as it enables him to short only  the mezzanine and senior tranches and avoid the equity which would have  been the most expensive tranche to go short (Shorting all the  underlying bonds is equivalent to shorting all the tranches of the CDO).  But nevertheless this is not common in structured products in any asset  class. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Most  structured products involve the market-maker constructing a bespoke  product for the client and managing the residual exposure via dynamic  hedging.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> So in  this case, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> would buy CDS referencing the  underlying bonds, sell as many tranches as it can or wants to sell, and  manage the residual exposure. In this case, that was the equity exposure  and in many other cases as I have analysed </span></span><a href="../2009/11/06/a-rational-explanation-of-the-financial-crisis/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">before</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, it was the super-senior tranche. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> If exact matching hedges had to be  found in the market for each product sold to a client, then the  business of structured products would not exist. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In this respect, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> assertion that each transaction  includes a long and short side is technically accurate but a little bit  disingenuous - most synthetic CDOs like most other structured products  do not have a market counterparty other than the market-maker who is  short exactly the same product. I suspect however that from a legal  perspective, this is not relevant. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"ACA, the Largest Investor, Selected  The Portfolio."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The  fact that ACA Asset Management was the "Portfolio Selection Agent" is </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> best </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">defense</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. But the assertion that ACA was the largest investor is true  only in the most trivial sense. ACA Asset Management which selected the  portfolio had no investment in Abacus. It was its parent company, ACA  Capital which in the course of its normal business of insuring  super-senior tranches had a $951 million exposure to the transaction.  This may seem like an irrelevant distinction but it is not. The usual  method of ensuring that the managers' interests are aligned to those of  the transaction would be to have the manager invest in the equity  tranche of the transaction as ACA had done in the past. As per slide 31  of the </span></span><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/30036962/Abacus-2007-Ac1-Flipbook-20070226"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">pitchbook</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, ACA had over $200 million invested  in the equity of the CDOs it manages. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All this tells us is that ACA Capital  trusted that its asset management subsidiary had done a competent job  and was more likely to guarantee against losses on the super-senior  given the role of ACA Asset Management. But did this influence the  incentives of ACA Asset Management and its asset managers? That seems  unlikely given that it was ACA Capital's prerogative to do its own due  diligence even if its asset management subsidiary was the manager of the  CDO in question and </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the decision to invest by ACA Capital was likely separate from,  albeit influenced by the decision to manage the CDO. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></em></span><em> </em><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sachs</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Never Represented to ACA That </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Was Going To Be A Long Investor"</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is clearly the  crux of the case. The SEC seems to assert that it was </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> responsibility to disabuse ACA of the  mistaken assumption it made that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was an equity investor. The complaint also quotes an email  from </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fabrice</span></span> <span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tourre</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to ACA where he explicitly refers to </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> as the "Transaction Sponsor" (page 14  of the </span></span><a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp-pr2010-59.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">complaint</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">). At best, this description is  misleading. <strong>It is a stretch to describe a counterparty who is short the exact tranches being marketed to investors as a "Transaction Sponsor".</strong> I suspect much of the case will  depend upon whether using the term "Transaction Sponsor" to describe </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was an act of deception. In this  respect, it is relevant whether there is any precedent of </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">counterparties</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> seeking to short the tranches being  referred to in this manner. My suspicion is that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> definition of "Transaction Sponsor"  does not have much precedent. None of this however absolves ACA of its  share of blame - it should have obtained written clarification that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paulson</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was the equity investor failing which  it should have refused to do the deal.<br />
