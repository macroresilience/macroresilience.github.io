  content: Right on.  Witch-hunts are still a very popular form of self-deception.  The
    chaos of incentives and unintended consequences is much harder to face.  Keep
    the eye on the prize - leverage.

    The inability or, worse, unwillingness of the financial houses and the bankers to actually track the swill that had been stuffed into these derivatives is disgusting. In an age when Google and Amazon can minutely detail your preferences through the creation of a proper data model, these so-called professionals come across as lazy and incompetent for not doing so.

    Of course, none of the criminal behavior - and that's what many of the strategies associated with shorting a long position because of the money that can be made appear to be - could have happened if this had actually been done. That wouldn't be any fun would it?


    Chaos indeed. In case no one's bothered to think this through, these markets are riven with non-linearities that insure the collapse of any effort to model them statistically, short of actually tracking what's in this junk.

    The risk equations are garbage. Books like The Black Swan barely touch on this. This is completely and absolutely unsustainable. It's easy to predict that if these markets are not taken apart, they will collapse again.

  content: 'Thanks for this. I listened to the "This American Life" summary of the
    ProPublica article, and wondered whether TAL''s "The Producers" analogy was facile;
    it''s good to see rigor applied to the discussion, even if I can''t really grasp
    all that''s involved. I even went back and read the 11/6/09 entry, and the Miller
    Modigliani article in the footnotes (until I hit the equations page, at which
    time, my inumeracy got the best of me). Here''s my question for admin: You write
    above that "bank demand for super-senior tranches is a logical consequence of
    the cheap leverage that they are afforded via the moral hazard subsidy of the
    TBTF doctrine." In Gillian Tett''s book _Fool''s_Gold_, J.P. Morgan''s team is
    portrayed as working hard to rid itself of super senior debt, and suffering in
    the marketplace because its competitors were happy to keep it on theirs on their
    balance sheet. Do you have any thoughts about this portrayal of the J.P. Morgan?'

  content: "David - Thanks. I haven't read Gillian Tett's book but your account makes
    sense. If JP was not willing to hold onto the super-senior debt, it would not
    be able to continue with its CDO issuance business unless it got someone to insure
    it (typically AIG or the monolines). This would leave it at a serious disadvantage
    compared to the competition. I've analysed UBS' shareholder report on their losses
    at the bottom of the 11/6/09 entry which explains the typical motivation of the
    banks pretty well. Else, a much more concise version of that first post can be
    found here https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/01/06/implications-of-moral-hazard-in-banking/
    . \n\nRegarding Modigliani Miller, the math really isn't that important in understanding
    it. In fact, the John Burr Williams version quoted in that article captures the
    essence of it without using a single equation!"

  content: Another great set of articles.  The further we get from the "end" of the
    crisis the more I agree with Taleb that everyting we have done is in the exact
    opposite direction.  Instead of getting away from credit markets everyone thinks
    that the solution is head right back into credit with a vengence.  I suspect alot
    of it has do with the implied government gurantee of debt and weariness of equity
    investments.  This smells of really bad logic.  Does anyone really think the government
    will beable to hold this siutation together forever?  History would say otherwise.  Governments
    wont beable to save big banks forever

    And how about the leser ones? The estimated number of small to mid-size banks with a liquidity crunch is staggering. What about them?

    It took a few years of depression-era pain for the full weight of the economic downfall to become apparent in the 1930s. In the current downturn the jobs needle hasn't budged for months now, with the actual number of unemployed/underemployed approaching 17% and holding. Where we go from here is hard to fathom if this lasts much longer. It's easy to predict, however, that the economic pain will lead to more political upheaval with the public lashing out at the most visible symbols of power.

According to Jesse </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Eisinger</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and Jake </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bernstein</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> went long the equity tranche and short the senior tranches and  used their position as the buyer of the equity tranche to ensure that  the asset quality of the CDO was poorer than it would otherwise be. <strong>If </strong></span></span><strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ProPublica's</span></span></strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> account is true, then this is a moral  hazard trade</strong> i.e. Magnetar buys insurance against the burning down of a house  and uses its influence as an equity buyer to significantly improve the  odds of the house burning. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">However, there are some hints in </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> response to the story that cast  significant doubt on the accuracy of </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ProPublica's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> narrative.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are two reasons to execute such a  strategy - one, simply to fund a "short options" strategy and the  second, to execute a market-neutral "arbitrage" strategy.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">However, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span> <a href="http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/magnetars-letter-in-response"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">describe</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> their portfolio as market-neutral and </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"designed to  have a positive return whether housing performed well or did poorly"</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This implies that the portfolio was carry-positive</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> i.e. the coupons on the long-equity  positions exceeded the running-premium cost of buying protection on the  senior tranches.

A net long  position measured in delta terms could easily imply a net short notional  position in which case the portfolio would outperform if all the  tranches in the CDO were wiped out. But </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> seem to make it clear in their response that in the deals  where they were the initial purchaser of equity, the notional of the  equity positions exceeded the notional of the senior positions that they  were short. They also assert that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"the majority of the notional value of </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar’s</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> hedges referenced CDOs in which </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> had no long investment" </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">i.e. of course the notional value of  their short positions exceeded that of their long positions, but these  short positions were in other CDOs in which they did not have a long  position. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But  what about the fact that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> seemed to be influencing the portfolio composition of these CDOs to  include riskier assets in them? Surely this proves conclusively that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> would profit if the CDOs collapsed? To  understand why this may not necessarily be true, we need to examine the  payoff profile of the </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> trade. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As  with most market-neutral "arbitrage" trades, it is unlikely that the  trade would deliver a positive return in every conceivable scenario.  Rather, it would deliver a positive return in every scenario that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> deemed probable. The </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> trade would pay off in two scenarios -  if there were no defaults in any of their CDOs, or if there were so  many defaults that the tranches that they were short also defaulted </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">alongwith</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the equity tranche. The trade would  likely lose money if there were limited defaults in all the CDOs and the  senior tranches did not default. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Essentially, the trade was attractive if one believed that  this intermediate scenario was improbable. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A distribution where intermediate  scenarios are improbable can arise from many underlying processes but  there is one narrative that is particularly relevant to complex adaptive  systems such as financial markets. Intermediate scenarios are unlikely  when the system is characterised by multiple stable states and "</span></span><a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cluster=18433305475448212103&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2000&amp;as_vis=1"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">catastrophic</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">" transitions between these states. In  adaptive systems such as ecosystems or </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">macroeconomies</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, such transitions are most likely when the system is fragile  and in a state of low resilience. The system tends to be dominated by  positive feedback processes that amplify the impact of small  perturbations, with no negative feedback processes present that can arrest this  snowballing effect. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It  turns out that such a framework was extremely well-suited to describing  the housing market before the crash. Once house prices started falling  and refinancing was no longer an option, the initial wave of defaults  triggered a vicious cycle of house price declines and further defaults.  Similarly, collateral requirements on leveraged investors,  mark-to-market pressures and other </span></span><a href="../2010/02/07/mark-to-market-accounting-and-the-financial-crisis/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">positive  feedback processes in the market</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> created a vicious cycle of price  declines in the market for </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">mortage</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-backed  securities and CDOs. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So  what does all this have to do with </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> desire to include riskier assets in their long equity portfolios?</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> If one believes that only a small  perturbation is required to tip the market over into a state of  collapse, then the long position should be weighted towards the riskiest  possible asset portfolio. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Essentially, the above framework implies that there is no  benefit to having "safer" long positions in the long-short portfolio.  The fragility of the system means that either there is no perturbation  and all assets perform no matter how low-quality they are, or there is a  perturbation and even "high quality" assets default. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The above framework of catastrophic  shifts between multiple stable states is not uncommon, especially in  fixed income markets. In fact, the Greek funding situation is a perfect  example. If one had to sketch out a distribution of the yield on Greek  debt, it is likely that intermediate levels are the least likely  scenarios. In other words, either Greece funds at low sustainable rates  or it moves rapidly to a state of default - it is unlikely that Greece  raises say 50 billion </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Euros</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> at  an interest rate of 10%. The situation is of course made even more stark  by Greece's inability to inflate away its debt via the printing press.  Of course, the bifurcation exists in fiat currency issuing countries as  well, but at the point when hyperinflation kicks in. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bank incentives are the real  problem</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Even  if my arguments are valid, it is nevertheless obvious that even if </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Magnetar</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> may not have executed the moral hazard  trade, someone else could quite easily have done so. But the moral  hazard trade was only possible because there was sufficient investor  demand for the rated tranches of the CDO and even more crucially,  because the originating bank was willing to hold onto the super-senior  tranche. As I have discussed many times earlier </span></span><a href="../2009/11/06/a-rational-explanation-of-the-financial-crisis/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">in detail</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> bank demand for super-senior tranches is a logical  consequence of the cheap leverage that they are afforded via the moral  hazard subsidy of the TBTF doctrine.
