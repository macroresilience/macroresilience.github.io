<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I have argued previously that the moral hazard explanation of the crisis fits the basic facts i.e. bank balance sheets were highly levered and invested in assets with severely negatively skewed payoffs. But this still leaves another objection to the moral hazard story unanswered - It was not only the banks with access to cheap leverage that were heavily invested in "safe" assets, but also asset managers, money market mutual funds and even ordinary investors. Why was this the case? </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A partial explanation which I have discussed many times before relies on the preference of </span></span><a href="/category/principal-agent-problem/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">agents</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (in the principal-agent sense) for such bets. But this is an incomplete explanation. Apart from not being applicable to investors who are not agents, it neglects the principal's </span></span><a href="/2009/12/28/information-asymmetry-and-the-principal-agent-problem/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">option to walk away</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. A much better explanation that I mentioned </span></span><a href="/2010/01/30/knightian-uncertainty-and-the-resilience-stability-trade-off/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">here</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and </span></span><a href="/2010/01/13/do-investors-prefer-negative-skewness/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">here</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> is the role of extended periods of stability in creating "moral hazard-like" outcomes. This is an altogether more profound and pervasive form of the moral hazard problem and lies at the heart of the </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="/2009/12/06/minskys-financial-instability-hypothesis-and-hollings-conception-of-resilience-and-stability/">Minsky</a></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="/2009/12/06/minskys-financial-instability-hypothesis-and-hollings-conception-of-resilience-and-stability/">-Holling thesis</a></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that stability breeds loss of resilience. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is important to note that such an outcome can arise endogenously without any government intervention. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Minsky</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> argued that such an endogenous loss of resilience was inevitable but this is not obvious. As I noted </span></span><a href="/2010/01/30/knightian-uncertainty-and-the-resilience-stability-trade-off/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">here</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"The assertion that an economy </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">can</span></em></span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> move outside the corridor due to endogenous factors is difficult to reject. All it takes is a chance prolonged period of stability. However, this does not imply that the economy </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">must</span></em></span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> move outside the corridor, which requires us to prove that prolonged periods of stability are the norm rather than the exception in a capitalist economy." </span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But it can also arise as a result of macro-stabilising fiscal and monetary policies. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Whether the current crisis was endogenous or not is essentially an empirical question. I have argued in previous posts that it was not and that the "</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Greenspan</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Put" monetary policy did as much damage as all the explicit bailouts did.
