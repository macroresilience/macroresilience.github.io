<p>The old voice of the ocean, the bird-chatter of little rivers,</p>
<p>(Winter has given them gold for silver</p>
<p>To stain their water and bladed green for brown to line their banks)</p>
<p>From different throats intone one language.</p>
<p>So I believe if we were strong enough to listen without</p>
<p>Divisions of desire and terror</p>
<p>To the storm of the sick nations, the rage of the hunger-smitten cities,</p>
<p>Those voices also would be found</p>
<p>Clean as a child's; or like some girl's breathing who dances alone</p>
<p>By the ocean-shore, dreaming of lovers.</p>
