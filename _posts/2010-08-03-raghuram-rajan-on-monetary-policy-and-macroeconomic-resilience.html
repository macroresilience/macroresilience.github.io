  content: I have a hard time believing anymore QE will result in anything, perhaps
    the biggest surprise will be the markets begin to turn against the goverment.

    To take these ideas seriously, do you have to believe that bankers are consciously taking decisions in anticipation of the central bank response in the event of a crisis?

    Or can you argue that bankers may think they are doing something else, but some mechanism in the system selects behaviour doing the things this theory predicts bankers will do? If so, what's the mechanism, and what do bankers think they are doing?

    Despite the Fed's response, didn't bank shareholders lose money, bankers lose jobs etc. because of the crisis. So I can't believe they deliberately took risky positions figuring everything will be okay when things go wrong. But perhaps that's not what you'd have me believe. Can you advise?

  content: shrek - I'm skeptical that conventional QE will have much impact. As I
    mentioned, diminishing returns mean that more and more radical policies need to
    be followed to extract smaller and smaller gains.

  content: Luis - Many of the posts on this blog are focused on arguing that conscious
    attempts by bankers to take advantage of the central bank's commitments are not
    necessary for moral hazard outcomes to come about - in fact selection mechanisms
    may select for bankers who genuinely believe in the risklessness of their strategies.

    I met Dr. Rajan when he spoke recently at the Cato Institute (in the Hayek Auditorium).  He gave a good talk on his book "Fault Lines."  Dr. Carmen Reinhart was there as well.  I eventually reviewed the book here:

    I also have suggested that ultralow rates aren't helping matters.  It certainly has not helped Japan.

    Keep up the good work.

  content: John - In the short run, outright deflation is doubtful unless we have
    another financial crisis. In the long run, the logical conclusion of the above
    is that eventually the Fed will lose the war even though it may win many battles
    in the interim. The only way to avoid this is if it starts monetising significant
    new fiscal stimulus programs but even this only delays the day when the war is
    lost.

    Thanks. Expansion to fight against structural adjustments is folly. The Fed can't win on that front, though it might have a prolonged retreat.

    Does stabilizing the general price level during restructuring necessarily involve one in that futile conflict, or is it separable? I'm thinking of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/01/28/the-lone-dissenter-lacker-wants-to-buy-treasurys/" rel="nofollow ugc">Lacker's Jan 2009 dissent</a> and his distinction of monetary from credit policy.

  content: I tend to agree with Jeffrey Lacker but the option of using quasi-fiscal
    credit policies to shore up confidence is always the easier one than engaging
    in QE on a large scale. But I'm not convinced that the kind of price stabilisation
    commitment we're trying is ultimately tenable in the long run - the system adapts
    to make the central banks' commitment an unstable regime. ( This is very speculative
    though - still formulating my thoughts on this )

    Congratulations on exiting the corporate world, Ashwin, and on your new found freedom to leave anonymity behind.

    I'm a bit late to this conversation, but hopefully not fatally so.

    So, a minor query. Is Rajan and Diamond's thesis really fundamentally different from ABCT? Couldn't the anticipatory mechanisms they describe simply be seen as one of the drivers that allowed excessive credit creation to persist for as long as it did? Another prop to confidence, if you like.

    I don't think such a view changes their underlying point at all but it does perhaps avoid the need for any additional conceptual framework.

  content: "Ingolf - Thank you!\n\nThe Rajan-Diamond argument clearly owes a debt
    to ABCT and they explicitly claim that their argument is a \"rational\" justification
    of ABCT. In fact, the theoretical argument in the paper uses a consumption vs
    investment dynamic that is very similar to ABCT. \n\nMy point is just that the
    resilience, adaptive argument is broader than the specific model they run though
    and it is also broader than ABCT. In many cases, it can be seen as one of the
    drivers of excessive credit creation in a low interest rate environment. But it
    essentially depends not so much on the low interest rates prevailing at a point
    of time, but on the anticipation of low interest rates and liquidity facilities
    when trouble hits. \n\nIt's just an opinion of course, but I think this explanation
    was most relevant to the Greenspan-Bernanke era. So for example, such a theory
    could even explain a bout of misguided credit expansion even when rates are not
    below their \"natural\" rate of interest - solely driven by the anticipation of
    protection by the banks in case things go wrong."

  content: "Agreed. There were (indeed, still are) so many implicit and explicit backstops
    built into the system that perceptions of risk underwent a seachange in recent
    decades. \n\nSuch elevated risk appetites can keep credit growing even when rates
    are very high indeed (I recall a period of near insane risk-taking and credit
    growth in New Zealand in the 1980s with rates at 20% plus). Of course, lunatic
    episodes like this tend to burn out fairly quickly whereas ones based on artificially
    low rates and perceived \"Greenspan put\" type safety nets can run on ad nauseam,
    as we saw.\n\nBy the way, I came across a particularly interesting article from
    Roger Garrison entitled \"Overconsumption and Forced Saving in the Mises-Hayek
    Theory of the Business Cycle\". He picks out weaknesses in Hayek's version of
    ABCT, in particular his failure to allow for overconsumption as well as malinvestment
    during a credit boom (Mises, on the other hand, readily accepted that the two
    often went hand in hand and exacerbated the damage). \n\nGarrison thinks these
    \"unperceived-or only dimly perceived-shortcomings in F. A. Hayek's theorizing
    may help explain why Hayek was largely ineffective in responding to his critics
    and why he failed to produce a timely and effective critique of Keynes's General
    Theory.\" Kind of makes sense to me. Anyway, it's of interest, you can find it
    here:\n\nhttp://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/strigl.htm"

<p>Amongst economic commentators, Raghuram Rajan has stood out recently for his consistent <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a19a706-9a7a-11df-87fd-00144feab49a.html ">calls</a> to raise interest rates from "ultra-low to the merely low". Predictably, this suggestion has been met with outright condemnation by many economists, both of <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/the-work-of-depressions/">Keynesian</a> and <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=5924">monetarist</a> persuasion. Rajan's <a href="http://blogs.chicagobooth.edu/n/blogs/blog.aspx?nav=main&amp;webtag=faultlines&amp;entry=14">case</a> against ultra-low rates utilises many arguments but this post will focus on just one of these arguments that is straight out of the "<a href="/category/resilience/">resilience</a>" playbook. In 2008, Raghu Rajan and Doug Diamond co-authored a <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/douglas.diamond/research/Diamond%20Rajan%20Interest.pdf">paper</a>, the conclusion of which Rajan summarises in his FT <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a19a706-9a7a-11df-87fd-00144feab49a.html">article</a>: <em>"the pattern of Fed policy over time builds expectations. The market now thinks that whenever the financial sector’s actions result in unemployment, the Fed will respond with ultra-low rates and easy liquidity. So even as the Fed has maintained credibility as an inflation fighter, it has lost credibility in fighting financial adventurism. This cannot augur well for the future."</em></p>
<p>Much like he <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/9593">accused</a> the Austrians, Paul Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/the-work-of-depressions/">accuses</a> Rajan of being a "liquidationist". This is not a coincidence - <strong>Rajan and Diamond's thesis is quite explicit about its connections to Austrian Business Cycle Theory</strong>: <em>"a central bank that promises to cut interest rates conditional on stress, or that is biased towards low interest rates favouring entrepreneurs, will induce banks to promise higher payouts or take more illiquid projects. This in turn can make the illiquidity crisis more severe and require a greater degree of intervention, a view reminiscent of the Austrian theory of cycles." </em>But as the summary hints, Rajan and Diamond's thesis is fundamentally different from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_business_cycle_theory">ABCT</a>. The conventional Austrian story identifies excessive credit inflation and interest rates below the "natural" rate of interest as the driver of the boom/bust cycle but <strong>Rajan and Diamond's thesis identifies the anticipation by economic agents of low rates and "liquidity" facilities every time there is an economic downturn as the driver of systemic fragility. The adaptation of banks and other market players to this regime makes the eventual bust all the more likely. </strong>As Rajan and Diamond note: <em>"If the authorities are expected to reduce interest rates when liquidity is at a premium, banks will take on more short-term leverage or illiquid loans, thus bringing about the very states where intervention is needed."</em></p>
<p>Rajan and Diamond's thesis is limited to the impact of such policies on banks but as I noted in a previous <a href="/2010/03/07/stability-as-profound-moral-hazard/">post</a>, market players also adapt to this implicit commitment from the central bank to follow easy money policies at the first hint of economic trouble. This thesis is essentially a story of the Greenspan-Bernanke era and the damage that the Greenspan Put has caused. <strong>It also explains the dramatically diminishing returns inherent in the Greenspan Put strategy </strong>as the stabilising policies of the central bank become entrenched in the expectations of market players and crucially banks - <strong>in each subsequent cycle, the central bank has to do more and more (lower rates, larger liquidity facilities) to achieve less and less.</strong></p>
