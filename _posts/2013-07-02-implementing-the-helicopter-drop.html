    Ashwin,
    At the ZLB, I'm not sure I understand what is accomplished by the Fed buying the bond.  Couldn't Treasury just issue it to the private sector at a zero yield?  It is, after all, the exact equivalent of IOR-paying reserves.

  content: Diego - but what when rates go up from zero in the future? The Treasury
    can't issue a perp at zero even today and if its just a floating rate 3-m t-bill,
    then we're again left to the criticism, however irrational, that the bond needs
    to be refinanced at regular intervals.

  content: "Ashwin,\nIf rates rise, it doesn't matter if the Fed or pvt sector owns
    the bond: the fiscal impact is the same.  \n\nYou could argue the Fed can delay
    recognition of the fiscal impact with deferred loss accounting.  I think the RE
    folks would probably argue the pvt sector would see through that eventually.  \n\nReserves
    are truly liquid: they can always be used for payment. This is why you don't hear
    banks complaining about owning gobs of a perpetual FRN.  I think if Treasury issued
    a PFRN, this instrument would also have the same use as reserves (it would be
    used for payments and be truly liquid)."

  content: "Ashwin, under this proposal monetary policy will directly raise the federal
    debt, and can be held hostage by Congress simply refusing to raise the debt limit.
    \n\nI would prefer the following: (i) create an account at the Fed for every US
    citizen with a valid social security number, including minors, (ii) stop transferring
    profits on Fed assets directly to the Treasury, (iii) credit all accounts in equal
    measure to dissipate all profits, (iv) restrict withdrawals from these accounts
    to tighten monetary policy, and remove restrictions to ease, (v) continue open
    market operations as necessary, especially in a liquidity crisis, lending at high
    rates against good collateral to solvent institutions in accordance with the Bagehot
    rule. \n\nThis last policy should result in windfall gains after a crisis. The
    direct transfers to account holders will boost aggregate demand when most needed."

    Sorry,
    I just do not get it.
    Why does 'bonding' almost always enter a 'helicopter drop' discussion these days?
    Friedman's original view was for printed money to enter the banking system as deposits, and the essentially critical aspect was that 100 percent of the money issued enter the national income stream for full effectiveness.
    Today, Lord Adair Turner is proposing an exact copy as that of Friedman,  both in terms of effort and effectiveness.
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhrY_coLK_k

    His Overt Permanent Money Finance(OPMF) proposal is based on Friedman's earlier Fiscal and Monetary Framework for Economic Stability.

    IF the implication of 'helicopter drop' money is demand-producing circulating media in the hands of the consumers, then let's first of all agree that it matters not which agency is piloting the helicopter, and also that the entire effort CAN take place without debt-burden considerations, which is what makes Turner's proposal "Permanent Money".
    Thanks.

  content: "Rajiv - Thanks. Your point is valid especially in the United States. My
    idea may still work in the UK for example where the debt limit is not a consideration.
    The motivation for this post was to find a way to implement the helicopter drop
    without making the central bank insolvent and to avoid the government having to
    refinance the debt either. \n\nI completely agree with your proposal. My only
    concern would be that it would limit the amount of money that could be disbursed
    as a helicopter drop especially in the midst of the crisis."

  content: joe - I agree with the idea of simply printing money and disbursing it.
    But this necessarily involves a significant loss incurred by the central bank

    below is a \"taxonomy\" where value is added by:\n\n1) issuing IOR-paying reserves\n2)
    Treasury increasing net fiscal spending \n3) Fed increasing net fiscal spending
    (Rajiv's above)\n\nFWIW, \n\n-I think 1) adds no value.  \n-2) can add value.

  content: "I wish I understood that.\nI see no reason whatsoever for the CB to incur
    any 'losses' on transactions such as proposed by Turner.\nHis slides indicate
    it not being a problem.\n\nTurner's proposal is funding the policy initiative
    through 'permanent money', as, once issued, it would remain in circulation in
    perpetuity, as money.\nThe CB books the permanent money created by Lincoln howsoever
    it chooses. Same for OMF.\nI think the problem is the inside the box thinking
    about reserves and debt.\nIssuing real money into existence - and it would be
    an exogenous MA issuance, even though the transmission mechanism is fiscal -  obviates
    any need for any reserve backing, and there is no debt issuance involved.\n \nThe
    CB can incur $Billions in losses when it re-markets its MBS holdings tomorrow.\nThose
    losses would affect the inter-governmental transfer from CB back to Tsy, resulting
    in increased borrowing requirements of the state, in exactly the same way as implementing
    a payroll tax holiday would do.\n\nAll  of that seems quite avoidable with a helicopter
    drop of permanent money issuance.\nThanks."

    T. Greer - Well, not really. Quantitative easing doesn't increase the government debt outstanding by itself. If the QE is deemed 'temporary', then the charge of monetising deficits is also countered. And the CB by buying assets at least postpones any potential loss on its balance sheet.

    The bailout is not explicit in QE - the CB can always say that it is buying assets at market price, that its actions are not reducing the yield on government bonds. But every CB apart from the Fed admits that QE reduces government bond yields, real interest rates and therefore increases asset prices.

    directly confronts the issue of "whose money is it?".  Each individual can decide

<p>Why are helicopter drops off limits for modern central banks and governments? Why do central banks and governments prefer to buy assets from banks and the rich rather than send money to the masses? There are three major reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the central bank simply prints money out of thin air and credits it to the people, then it suffers a loss. If the helicopter drop is sufficiently large, then the central bank may even become technically insolvent. Although this has <a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp392.pdf">very few technical implications</a> for the functioning of a central bank, the political implications are significant. Opponents of the stimulus will latch on to the losses as a sign of monetary irresponsibility. The political implications and fear of loss of central banking independence may even have a negative impact on the economy. Understandably, central banks prefer to avoid such a situation. By buying financial assets, central bank governors can at least postpone losses for long enough that it becomes the next governor’s headache.</li>
<li>If the helicopter drop is financed by a bond issuance by the government, then many market participants fear that the government debt will increase to unsustainable levels that cannot be paid back.</li>
<li>If the helicopter drop is financed by a bond issued by the government and bought by the central bank, then some commentators fear that we will have crossed the rubicon into the dangerous world of monetised fiscal deficits.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have written <a href="/2012/10/17/monetary-and-fiscal-economics-for-a-near-credit-economy/">in the past</a> on how these concerns are largely mistaken. But perceptions matter, not least because markets are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)">reflexive</a>. So the question is: How can we design a systematic program of helicopter drops that tackles the above concerns? The below is one possible solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>The helicopter drop should be financed by a perpetual bond issued by the government and bought by the central bank. The perpetual bond pays an overnight floating interest rate equivalent to the Federal Funds rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The perpetual nature of the bond means that the government will never have to pay it back. The floating rate paid on the bond means that interest rate risk on the central bank’s balance sheet is negligible and it can hold the bond at par value on its balance sheet. The central bank’s inflation target is left unchanged which means that fiscal deficits cannot be monetised without limit.</p>
