    Great to hear!

    You have definitely become one of my favorite bloggers as of late.  I think that the mainstream, austrians, post-keynesians, and market moneterists all could benefit from reading your material.

<p>Over the next few months, I will post a lot more frequently on this blog. But most of my posts will not be long essays but shorter off-the-cuff notes and responses to blog posts elsewhere.</p>
<p>The primary reason for this change is that I’m writing a longer, book-length piece on the <a href="http://alittledisorder.com/resilience-across-domains/economics/technological-unemployment-amidst-stagnation/#fn:berliner">‘invisible foot’</a>. Hence its unlikely that I will find the time and energy to write too many other long-form essays on economics. But my reading and writing sessions generate quite a few byproducts which will find their way here.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
