    Well said.  We need real risk in the financial economy to produce good behavior without the Fed behind as a safety net.  As it is, the Fed encourages bad behavior by its implicit protection of the speculative culture.

    Exactly. The implications of protecting financial claims also corrupt the incentive

    While I agree with your thoughts ashwin I don't think macro stabilisation is simply a policy 'choice'. Let us assume that real growth in a capitalist economy after population growth is factored out comes about as a result of productivity gains. Productivity gains are basically due to an increase in specialisation.

    From the perspective of labour, increased specialisation is a big risk because in the kind of creatively destructive, micro-unstable environment you advocate, specialists are much more vulnerable to exogenous shocks (whether due to technology demographics, finance etc) than generalists are. What appears a moderate shock from an economy wide perspective would end millions of careers which matters not one jot to an economist interested in macro stability but it sure as hell will make individuals think twice about whether it makes more sense to learn how to design wind turbines for example, or stick with something safe like being a doctor or banker.

    Once given specialisms become sufficiently technologically complex such that switching between them is not practical for the typical individual in their working life, the whole foundation of the Shumpeter-ian view of the benefits of creative destruction is called into question. In fact he foresaw this himself, in his famous description of how capitalism must be hoist by its own petard as a result.

    education and local government (which also tend to be reliant in various structural
    ways on state support) that one finds most if not all of the deeply entrenched
    cronyism. \n\nBecause creative destruction doesn't impact them like it does the
    sectors which are actually at the sharp end of driving productivity growth, we
    get the kind of stagnation you are talking about.\n\nSo until the playing field
    here is levelled, don't expect chip designers and biotechnologists to be rallying
    to your cause!"

    but is driven by political interests, I agree. I've discussed Mancur Olson's work
    before. It can even be argued that the human desire for order has something to
    do with all this. But in the process of writing about all this, I'd have to write
    a book instead of a blog post! :-)\n\nYour point about micro-instability is spot
    on and hence why I support intervention via direct transfers to affected individuals
    in times of generalised distress. I also think that in a less stable environment,
    individuals will choose to be less specialised or more multi-skilled. Part of
    the problem is that the amount of efficiency-seeking and specialisation itself
    increases in response to the artificially stabilised environment. \n\nJust another
    point - many parts of finance, esp. investment banking are in fact way more super-specialised
    than most other jobs."

    stabilisation may be dictated by the moving parts of advanced human technological
    civilisation. It may be that there was no other policy choice that is compatible
    with increasing specialisation and hence with real growth.\n\nIf in a less stable
    environment individuals opt for less specialisation then we shall have less (or
    more likely negative) productivity gain and less growth. To make the modern IT
    infrastructure work we **need** individuals who spend 10 years in education learning
    the basics of semiconductor design, and who then spend another 10 or 15 years
    specialising in spending signals across 10cm of copper track at 5gbit/second.
    What's more, to have a competitive environment in this specific area, we need
    perhaps 4-10 times as many such people, of whom perhaps one half will end up working
    for unprofitable companies. Then, when the technology is successful, it gets commoditised
    and transferred to low wage manufacturing zones, the design work falls off and
    this poor bum has to pick a new spin-off area of technical expertise and hope
    he picks the right one.\n\nIf these individuals opt out of this process early
    on, we simply shan't have the technology, period, let alone healthy competition
    in that sector.\n\nThe same argument applies to financial specialists - who presumably
    have driven much of the much maligned recent \"innovation\". But in a micro-unstable
    environment, we'll need that innovation (hopefully directed toward more useful
    models and techniques) to allow financial intermediaries to have a chance to survive
    and hence to offer their risk bearing services. We'll need experts in options
    pricing and so on, not just loan salesmen and risk management executives.\n\n\nIf
    I'm a specialist I don't want to have to rely on government policy largesse such
    as transfers to put me on a level playing field with a family doctor or dentist
    or lawyer, because I can't rely on government policy holding steady for my working
    life. \n\nSorry to go on at length about this, but what you are proposing is deeply
    unfair to those sectors we most rely on for growth, unless the creative destruction
    applies equally throughout the workforce.\n\nAnother issue related to increasing
    specialisation is it requires increasing population size. \n\nThere is also the
    notion that shumpeterian competition may actually be less efficient than some
    form of 'ikea socialism' in a situation in which output is energy or land constrained
    rather than constrained by human or financial capital."

    Seems to me that the flat yield curve is not doing anything to increase rents to the finance sector - in fact their profits are plummeting and stocks are now under performing the non financial sector.

    And even if that were not the case, simply diverting that flow of rents to the sectors I have outlined is not useful from a macro-stability perspective.

    that is public knowledge. What they definitely will be doing is accumulating capital,
    mostly in the currency of the realm. As more and more capital fights it out for
    fewer ideas (as you yourself have mentioned, the no. of people taking risks specializing
    is seriously reduced in the new micro-volatile scenario), the balance tilts in
    the favour of the entrepreneur. It's all  played out at the margin.\n\nOverall,
    growth is slower, but more sure. More people are generalists for longer. I can't
    say  for sure that that would be a bad thing. Maybe there is no team that can
    design the pentium chip in 2011, but there could be a vast army of electronics
    enthusiasts who are aware of the basics of electronics, of logic gates, etc.\n\nThe
    only downside, in a cosmic sense, due to the slower growth might be the number
    of people who die waiting for a cure for aging, but that is just my personal transhumanist

    Ashwin

    While the broader point about the resilience vs stability tradeoff is certainly correct, you may be overstating the case by saying that macroeconomic stability leads to a low innovation economy. 'Let's give up this idea because it doesn't provide the opportunity (or is one-period dominated) for regulatory arb' is a thought process that may afflict some large organisations, but it's hard to think of that as applicable to the broader set of business managers and entrepreneurs across the world economy. Could it simply be the Jack Welch and GE saw that large parts of the world economy were under-financed, saw that as the big global opportunity and simply did that in the most financially efficient way possible given the then present scenarios?

    But more fundamentally, is the resultant lack of resilience is in itself argument enough to give up the pursuit of stability. Is the fact that most pathogens eventually become resistant a good reason to ditch trying to make superior anti-biotics?

    firms to invest in high-risk exploratory innovation. This is especially true for
    incumbent firms who are primarily motivated to protect their competitive rents

    also accelerates the influence of Olsonian special interests and makes new firm
    entry, a point which I analysed in this earlier post https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/11/24/the-cause-and-impact-of-crony-capitalism-the-great-stagnation-and-the-great-recession/
    . \n\nIt's not the invention of antibiotics that is the problem - its the persistent

    Ashwin, this paper is worth a look:

    http://www.iussp.org/Bangkok2002/S17Peng.pdf

    It suggests that productivity is mainly governed by transaction costs. Well managed high density populations will have lower transaction costs and that is what supports beneficial division of labour. However high activity-learning costs also increase division of labour, but to the *detriment* of per capita income. The paper notes that transaction costs are lowered by merging of populations and markets.

    Therefore it might be argued that macro-stabilisation which lowers transaction costs increases productivity and I think there is much evidence for this increase the last 3 decades. Therefore a micro-chaotic economy will increase transaction costs (it must do so) and will retard the possibility of productivity increases.

    I have also kind of argued that the innovations at the margin which will in future deliver marginal increase in productivity will create activities with high learning cost. Combined with micro-chaos the result will not be an acceleration of innovation.

    That's not to say that micro-chaos isn't preferable overall due to the minimising of catastrophic outcomes, but there must be a price to be paid and the bill will arrive in the form of reduced productivity.

    I also think that there are options for retaining macro-stabilisation but with a different intermediation structure that would not deliver creative destruction but would deliver resilience.

  content: "Scepticus, \n\nYou've given me something to think about. As of now, I
    see a few patterns. \n\nFirst about the well paying jobs -  When surveys are taken,
    they are taken of a large number of people. Large numbers, almost by definition,
    are present in the core. Plus, there are a lot of medical and construction related
    activities there - heavily regulated and possibly not valid examples. Regulatory
    changes favouring medical tourism and ready to assemble buildings might change
    the picture. \n\nYou agree that growth might be slower in a micro-chaotic environment.
    I say the same. But this will be a more resilient environment, I believe and an
    environment in which people will try to be flexible and try really hard to learn
    different things. I don't see this as a bad thing. \n\nDedicated effort to perfecting
    an art will be done in those arts that are relatively well-established and possibly
    by people who are passionate about the art itself, irrespective of its commercial
    value. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The horizon will continue to expand,
    but slower.\n\nOne of the few sure shots as you mentioned in a later post is to
    try to brute force specialisation by bringing together people and markets. Have
    more cities and connect them better. I totally agree. Nice way of having our cake
    and eating it too, but this strategy will also be subject to limits.\n\nAbout
    the options to retain resilience without the micro-chaos of creative destruction,
    I'm not able to visualise anything like that. Please feel free to elaborate."

    all the points you make are valid in increasing exploitative efficiency and productivity
    but in terms of exploration, the 'destruction' in creative destruction is unavoidable.\n\nAs
    for micro-chaos and macro-resilience, we're getting deep into systems analysis
    here. I wrote a geeky post on this a while ago https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/08/30/evolvability-robustness-and-resilience-in-complex-adaptive-systems/
    \n\nBut there's more to this - in complex adaptive systems across domains, intermittent
    periods of stability and efficiency/homogeneity winning out over slack/diversity
    are unavoidable. But the system somehow maintains resilience in a near-optimal
    state through a few mechanisms - constant stream of new entrants (even if most
    of them fail) in economic systems, degeneracy in biological systems, \"weak links\"
    in ecological systems. In all these, some level of disturbance is necessary but

    fragile. \n\nAnyway, I've been planning to write more on the work done in systems
    biology/ecology on this topic but my own thoughts on it are nowhere near as coherent

    to preserve resilience by giving up a small amount of efficiency."

    Ashwin, if we take the period 1250-1700, how much exploration do we think is taking place versus exploitation optimisation?

    The modern period, roughly since say 1750, clearly exhibits periods of alternating focus on exploration and exploitation.

    What I'm saying is that the future (and the dominant constraints in the future) may not be like the recent past.

    Also what works depends on what the cultural imperative is - for the egyptians who had decided that huge monuments were a key output, I presume exploitation would be more critical than exploration - since one can only afford one pyramid per few generations.

    How does this question fit into the biological systems analogy?

    And even in social systems, the empirical historical evidence can support a similar

    "The implicit assumption in any resilience argument is that the broader system is one worth preserving. If that doesn’t hold, then even systemic collapse is no bad thing. "

    Agreed. But I would not characterise the 'broader system' as capitalism, I'd characterise the broader system as a "socially stable technological planetary-scale human civilisation".

    It makes no sense to consider capitalism as the thing to be preserved -frankly I couldn't care less about capitalism as an end in itself (in any case we can define it how we like), what matters is saving an advanced tool using society such that it can continue to perpetuate itself reliably. No other starting point makes sense.

    I think this implied assumption vis-a-vis the broader system on your part is what has given rise to the main thrust of my objections.

  content: "I'm not denying the usefulness of innovation. The manorial system of the
    middle ages managed a good deal of innovation that resulted in population growth
    to levels that wasn't matched again until the mid C18th. Shumperterian capitalism
    isn't the only way of skinning that cat.\n\n1350-1750, there may not have been
    much innovation in industrial/primary extraction terms, but what did arise during
    this time was nation states and money. \n\nI think it all depends which of the
    various societal development vectors one considers as innovation, which is a matter
    of terminology and interpretation.\n\ne.g.: www.csiic.ca/PDF/IntellectualNo1.pdf\n\nfrom
    the intro:\n\n\"Briefly stated, innovation has become the emblem of the modern
    society, a panacea for resolving many problems, and a phenomenon to be studied.
    As H. Nowotny defines our epoch: it is a fascination and quest for innovation
    ...\"\n\n\"This suggests three questions. First, why has innovation acquired such
    a central place in our society or, put differently, where precisely does the idea
    of innovation come from? To many, innovation is a relatively recent phenomenon
    and its study more recent yet: innovation has acquired real importance in the
    twentieth century. In point of fact, however, innovation has always existed. The
    concept itself emerged centuries ago. This suggests a second question: why did
    innovation come to be defined as technological innovation? Many people spontaneously
    understand innovation to be technological innovation.\"\n\nit goes on in that
    vein."

  content: "[...] In order to meet their stabilisation mandate, central banks have
    implicitly taken on a mandate to backstop and stabilise the entire spectrum of
    liquid asset markets. If the central banks influence anything that could be termed
    as money supply in the modern credit economy, they do so via their influence on
    asset price levels (influenced in turn through the central bank’s actions on present
    interest rates, future interest rate path and liquidity). In a collateral-dependent
    credit economy, the Greenspan Put is the logical end-point of the stabilisation
    processes, the modern motto of which could be summarised as: &#8216;Focus on collateral
    values and the money supply will take care of itself&#8217;. Successive stabilisation
    leaves the economy in a condition where all economic actors have moved away from
    the idiosyncratic, illiquid economic risks that are the essence of an innovative,
    entrepreneurial economy towards the homogeneous liquid risks of a stagnant economy
    (detailed argument here). [...]"
---
<p>The argument against stabilisation is akin to a <a href="/2010/03/07/stability-as-profound-moral-hazard/">broader, more profound form</a> of the moral hazard argument. But the ecological ‘systems’ approach is much more widely applicable than the conventional moral hazard argument for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The essence of the Minskyian explanation is not that economic agents get fooled by the period of stability or that they are irrational. It is that there are sufficient selective forces (especially amongst principal-agent relationships) in the modern economy that the moral hazard outcome can be achieved even <a href="/2010/01/01/moral-hazard-a-wide-definition/">without any active intentionality</a> on the part of economic agents to game the system.</li>
<li>The micro-prudential consequences of stabilisation and moral hazard are dwarfed by their macro-prudential systemic consequences. The composition of agents changes and becomes less diverse as those firms and agents that try to follow more resilient or less leveraged strategies will be <a href="/2010/03/13/notes-on-the-evolutionary-approach-to-the-moral-hazard-explanation/">outcompeted and weeded out</a> - this loss of diversity is exacerbated by banks’ adaptation to the <a href="/2011/09/12/bagehots-rule-central-bank-incentives-and-macroeconomic-resilience/">intervention strategies preferred by central banks</a> in order to minimise their losses. And most critically, the suppression of disturbances <a href="/2011/06/08/forest-fire-suppression-and-macroeconomic-stabilisation/">increases the connectivity</a> and reduces the ‘patchiness’ and modularity of the macroeconomic system. In the absence of disturbances, connectivity builds up within the network, both within and between scales. Increased within-scale connectivity increases the severity of disturbances and increased between-scale connectivity increases the probability that a disturbance at a lower level will propagate up to higher levels and cause systemic collapse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Macro-stabilisation therefore breeds fragility in the financial sector. But what about the real economy? One could argue that in the long run, it is creative destruction in the real economy that drives economic growth and surely macro-stabilisation does not impede the pace of long-run innovation? Moreover, even if non-financial economic agents were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky">‘Ponzi borrowers’</a>, wouldn’t real economic shocks be sufficient to deliver the “disturbances” consistent with macroeconomic resilience? Unfortunately, the assumption that nominal income stabilisation has no real impact is too simplistic. <strong>Macroeconomic stabilisation is one of the key drivers of the process of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financialization">financialisation</a> through which it transmits financial fragility throughout the real economy and hampers the process of exploratory innovation and creative destruction.</strong></p>
<p>Financialisation is a term with many definitions. Since my focus is on financialisation in the corporate domain (rather than in the household sector), Greta Krippner’s <a href="http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/wray/631Wray/Week%207/Krippner.pdf">definition</a> of financialisation as a <em>““pattern of accumulation in which profit making occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production”</em> is closest to the mark. But from a resilience perspective, it is more accurate to define financialisation as a <em>“pattern of accumulation in which <strong>risk-taking</strong> occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production”</em>.</p>
<p>In the long run, creating any source of stability in a capitalist economy incentivises economic agents to realign themselves to exploit that source of security and thereby reduce risk. Similar to how banks adaptation to the <a href="/2011/09/12/bagehots-rule-central-bank-incentives-and-macroeconomic-resilience/">intervention strategies preferred by central banks</a> by taking on more “macro” risks, <strong>macro-stabilisation incentivises real economy firms to shed idiosyncratic micro-risks and take on financial risks instead. Suppressing nominal volatility encourages economic agents to shed real risks and take on nominal risks.</strong> In the presence of the Greenspan/Bernanke put, a strategy focused on “macro” asset price risks and leverage outcompetes strategies focused on “risky” innovation.  Just as banks that exploit the guarantees offered by central banks outcompete those that don’t, real economy firms that realign themselves to become more bank-like outcompete those that choose not to.</p>
<p>The poster child for this dynamic is the <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/immelt-ge-capital-and-the-financialization-of-manufacturing/">transformation</a> of <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eLtsCwfpxNAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Financialization%20and%20Strategy:%20Narrative%20and%20Numbers&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">General Electric</a> during the Jack Welch Era, when <em>“GE’s no-growth, blue-chip industrial businesses were run for profits and to maintain the AAA credit rating which was then used to expand GE Capital.”</em> Again, the financialised strategy outcompetes all others and drives out “real economy” firms. As Doug Rushkoff <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e2YCuxBjkq0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">observed</a>, <em>“the closer to the creation of value you get under this scheme, the farther you are from the money”</em>. General Electric’s strategy is an excellent example of how financialisation is not just a matter of levering up the balance sheet. It could just as easily be focused on aggressively extending leverage to one’s clients, a strategy that is just as adept at delivering low-risk profits in an environment where the central bank is focused on avoiding even the <a href="/2011/09/22/operation-twist-and-the-limits-of-monetary-policy-in-a-credit-economy/">smallest snap-back</a> in an elastic, over-extended monetary system. When central bankers are focused on preventing significant pullbacks in equity prices (the Greenspan/Bernanke put), then real-economy firms are incentivised to take on more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_risk">systematic risk</a> and reduce their idiosyncratic risk exposure.</p>
<p>Some Post-Keynesian and Marxian economists also claim that this process of financialisation is responsible for the reluctance of corporates to invest in innovation. As Bill Lazonick <a href="http://www.theairnet.org/files/research/lazonick/Lazonick%20FUSE%2020101003.pdf">puts it</a>, <em>“the financialization of corporate resource allocation undermines investment in innovation”</em>. This ‘investment deficit’ has in turn led to the secular downturn in productivity growth across the Western world since the 1970s, a phenomenon that Tyler Cowen has coined as <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/01/the-great-stagnation.html">‘The Great Stagnation’</a>. This thesis, appealing though it is, is too simplistic. <strong>The increased market-sensitivity combined with the macro-stabilisation commitment encourages low-risk process innovation and discourages uncertain and exploratory product innovation.</strong> The collapse in high-risk, exploratory innovation is exacerbated by the rise in the influence of special interests that accompanies any extended period of stability, a dynamic that I discussed in an earlier <a href="/2010/11/24/the-cause-and-impact-of-crony-capitalism-the-great-stagnation-and-the-great-recession/">post</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to explain the above dynamic is to take a slightly provocative example. Let us assume that the Fed decides to make the ‘Bernanke Put’ more explicit by either managing a floor on equity prices or buying a significant amoubt of equities outright. The initial result may be positive but in the long run, firms will simply align their risk profile to that of the broader market. The end result will be a homogenous corporate sector free of any disruptive innovation - a state of perfect equilibrium but also a state of rigor mortis.</p>
