<p>One of my favourite economists with a humorous take on the age-old debate:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A Conservationist's Lament</strong></p>
<p>The world is finite, resources are scarce,<br />
Things are bad and will be worse.<br />
Coal is burned and gas exploded,<br />
Forests cut and soils eroded.<br />
Wells are dry and air's polluted,<br />
Dust is blowing, trees uprooted,<br />
Oil is going, ores depleted,<br />
Drains receive what is excreted.<br />
Land is sinking, seas are rising,<br />
Man is far too enterprising.<br />
Fire will rage with Man to fan it,<br />
Soon we'll have a plundered planet.<br />
People breed like fertile rabbits,<br />
People have disgusting habits.</p>
<p>Moral:<br />
The evolutionary plan<br />
Went astray by evolving Man.</p>
<p><strong>The Technologist's Reply</strong></p>
<p>Man's potential is quite terrific,<br />
You can't go back to the Neolithic.<br />
The cream is there for us to skim it,<br />
Knowledge is power, and the sky's the limit.<br />
Every mouth has hands to feed it,<br />
Food is found when people need it.<br />
All we need is found in granite<br />
Once we have the men to plan it.<br />
Yeast and algae give us meat,<br />
Soil is almost obsolete.<br />
Men can grow to pastures greener<br />
Till all the earth is Pasadena.</p>
<p>Moral:<br />
Man's a nuisance, Man's a crackpot.<br />
But only Man can hit the jackpot.</p></blockquote>
