    Well said.  The demand for highly rated yield in a yield-starved environment drove much of the action.  There are two sides to every trade, and with "big boys" on each side, yield hogs lost, and the other side gained.

    Even if there were no rating agencies, this could have happened.  Boom and bust cycles are common in credit.

  content: The SEC will no more improve the rating agencies than it has the CPA business.  The
    same principal-agent problems affect CPAs and rating agencies and the SEC has
    never in 34 years now, done anything to fix them.

    Fine article - don't understand this point:

    "The critical assumption behind the idea of a centralised clearing platform is that the total notional of bonds that exist and need to be rated is constant i.e. it assumes that the actions of the ratings agencies only divide up the ratings market and do not expand or contract it."

    Why does A (centralised clearing platform) assume B (constant total notional) - you lost me there, and I don't see where you make it clear in the article as to why you think this relationship exists.

    More broadly, the answer to the ratings agencies to me, seems rather obvious - the buy-side, who is properly incentivized to provide accurate ratings should pay for the ratings.  This, of course, will make transparent price discovery very challenging (firm A rates Bond X as AAA, firm B rates Bond X as AAB).  But how can we create any system that doesn't create incentives to rate the bonds higher than they should be?  I'd be interested in to hear what you view as possible solutions.

  content: "Damian - Let me try and explain it better. \n\nLet's assume that there
    is only one rating agency with a monopoly - by the logic of those who argue for
    the centralised clearing platform, this should mitigate the problem of competition
    amongst agencies leading to more lenient ratings. And this is true of corporate
    bonds where in most cases, the rating being worse than expected does not prevent
    the corporate from going ahead and issuing the bond. But this is not true in structured
    products where if the agency does not rate a product AAA, it just does not get
    issued/come into existence. So the agency is still incentivised to give lenient
    ratings because the volume of total bonds that are issued is critically dependent
    on its ratings methodology being lenient. \n\nas i conclude above \"even if there
    was just one monopolistic rating agency that was paid by the regulator, the agency
    would have been almost as aggressive in rating new structures just because of
    the indisputable fact that the agency got paid only when a deal got done, and
    lenient ratings standards got more deals done.\""

Each issuer that would like its debt rated would have  to approach this platform which would then choose an agency to rate the  debt. The issuer would still have to pay for the rating  but the agency would be chosen by the regulator. In their words, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"This model has the advantage of  simultaneously solving (i) the free rider problem because the issuer  still pays, (</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ii</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">) the conflict of interest problem  because the agency is chosen by the regulating body, and (</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">iii</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">) the competition problem because  the regulator's choice can be based on some degree of excellence,  thereby providing the rating agency with incentives to invest resources,  innovate, and perform high quality work."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The critical assumption behind the  idea of a centralised clearing platform is that the total notional of  bonds that exist and need to be rated is constant i.e. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it assumes that the actions of the  ratings agencies only divide up the ratings market and do not expand or  contract it.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> So  for example, a trillion dollars worth of bonds would be issued each  year and the regulator would choose who rates which bond thus ensuring  that none of the rating agencies are </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">incentivised</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to give favourable ratings to junk assets. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This assumption may hold for  corporate bonds, but it is nowhere close to being true for structured  bonds like CDOs which were the source of the losses in the crisis. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are some  fundamental differences between the ratings process for corporate bonds  and the process for structured products such as CDOs. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Whether a corporate bond is issued  or not is usually not critically dependent on the rating assigned to it. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For example, the fact that a corporate bond is  rated as BBB instead of single-A will most likely not prevent the bond  from being issued.</span></span><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A firm usually decides to undertake a bond issuance depending  on its financing needs and unless the achieved rating is dramatically  different from expectations, the bond will be issued and fees will be  paid to the ratings agency. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the other hand, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">whether a structured bond is issued or not is critically  dependent on the ratings methodology applied to it. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A structured bond is constructed via  an iterative process involving the bank, the investor and the ratings  agency.</span></span><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> If  the ratings methodology for a structured product is not generous enough  to provide the investor with a yield comparable to equivalently rated  assets and to enable the bank to earn a reasonable fee, the bond will just  not get issued. When it comes to structured bonds, bonds are not created  first and rated next. Instead the rating given to the bond is critical  in determining whether it is issued and correspondingly, whether the  ratings agency gets paid. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If each one of the ratings agencies that are  part of the centralised platform adopts a stringent ratings methodology  that destroys the economics of the trade, the bond is not issued and  none of the agencies earns the fee. </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In this manner, the agencies are still </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">incentivised</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to loosen their standards even in the  absence of competition from other agencies. When it comes to structured  bonds, ratings agencies have historically been focused as much on  expanding the market as competing with each other. Indeed, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the biggest catalyst in expanding  rating agency profits over the last two decades has been the steady  expansion of the universe of products that they were willing to rate  using a generous methodology </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">from vanilla bonds/loans/mortgages to tranches of bond  portfolios to tranches of synthetic exposures to even complex algorithms  and trading strategies - the crowning example of the last variety being  the </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_Proportion_Debt_Obligation"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">CPDO</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Even when one of the agencies was  the first-mover in rating a new product, it could not adopt too  stringent a methodology for fear of killing the deal altogether. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, the very notion of  restricting the choice of agencies that can rate a given structured bond  is an oxymoron given the iterative process - let us assume that a  particular type of structured bond is leniently rated by only one of the  three ratings agencies. If the agency assigns the bond at random to  another agency, the bank can merely make a small modification to the  underlying portfolio and try its luck again till it gets allocated to  the right agency. The inherently iterative ratings process also explains  why the furore over ratings agencies making their models public is a  red herring, as I  have explained in a previous </span></span><a href="../2010/04/24/rating-agencies-financial-regulation-and-goodharts-law/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">post</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am not claiming that competition  between the agencies did not make things worse at the margin in the  financial crisis. But a tangible difference to the outcome in the crisis  would have been achieved only if the ratings agencies had adopted such a  stringent methodology that would have caused </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">subprime</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> CDOs and many other leveraged/risky  structures to not be issued at all. Given the demand for AAA assets with  extra yield (driven by internal and external regulations), this could  have been achieved only by an explicit ban on rating such structures. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Else, even if there was just one  monopolistic rating agency that was paid by the regulator, the agency  would have been almost as aggressive in rating new structures just  because of the indisputable fact that the agency got paid only when a  deal got done, and lenient ratings standards got more deals done. </span></strong></span></p>
