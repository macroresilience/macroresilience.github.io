    “In the case of the United States which issues its own currency, the need for maturity transformation can simply be eliminated by adjusting the government debt maturity profile accordingly.”

    Yes, but you can eliminate it only by changing the institutional framework as well.

    E.g. if the government stops issuing bonds altogether, a government bank could issue deposits corresponding to deficits. That would probably satisfy all the demand for short term liquid deposits and provide a pretty direct way of insuring them as well. Existing commercial and investment banks and others would be forced to issue maturity matching liabilities for their assets. It’s also in essence a form of 100 per cent reserve system.

    Otherwise, commercial banks have no practical way of fully matching the maturity of the short term deposits they issue now. It is not the intention to mismatch so much as the demand for short term deposits from the public and the lack of natural supply of short term loans on the other side. It is a structurally forced mismatch. And even though pension funds tend to have the reverse mismatch problem to banks, there is no way of combining the risk in aggregate in such a way to solve the problem of effectively matching very short term bank deposits under the existing institutional framework.

    Finally, you should distinguish between commercial bank and investment banking functions as they relate to mismatches. Commercial banking mismatches in liquidity are to a great degree non-discretionary. Again, that’s because the banking public demands short duration deposits as liquidity and money, and you’re never going to have a natural source of short duration assets to match. On the other hand, investment bank functions are mostly discretionary when it comes to mismatching because they require wholesale funding choices as opposed to comparatively passive retail deposit gathering.

  content: "JKH - Thanks for the comment. \n\nSo yes, to the extent that there is
    demand for short-term liquid deposits, I'd rather the govt issue T-bills to back
    deposits or even deposits directly. I am leaving the option to issue bonds open
    because depending on the ALM demand from pension funds etc, it may still be worthwhile
    to issue bonds. For example, the UK has a much longer average maturity of debt
    outstanding than the US primarily because its ALM rules on liability-matching
    generate a much greater demand on the long-end. \n\nI'm still not convinced that
    we need to force matching or move to a narrow banking system for two reasons:\n\nOne,
    the ability of the economy as a whole to get around these rules but especially
    the banks. In this speech http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2010/speech455.pdf
    Mervyn King made the point that macro-mismatch can go up without micro-mismatch
    being detectable by regulators i.e. micro-prudential regs + gaming results in
    macro-fragility. \n\nTwo, we're taking away the point of elasticity of money supply
    from the banking system to the govt. So way I understand it, banks cannot create
    horizontal money ex nihilo anymore. But I could be mistaken on this - there may
    be some way to preserve this capacity. I still tend to lean to the Schumpeterian
    view that this elasticity to fund new projects is important, but it's also possible
    that the long-term funds coming from PFs, insurers etc make this ability redundant."

    many instances is correct. I'd only add that the evolution of the shadow banking

    "As Rajiv Sethi points out, even non-banking firms engage in maturity transformation and any attempt to stamp it out is futile. "

    I think this is wrong : maturity transformation could be restricted to firms with low leverage (say a liabilities to equity ratio of 2 or 3). That will leave most non-banking firms out, and the non-banking firms which would remain would be quite likely to be doing some kind of financing activity

    Additionally, maturity tranformation should be automatically associated with stringent mark-to-market of financed assets. The dualities MTM/transformed funding vs Held-to-maturity/matched funding are fundamental. Of course, bankers don't want to hear about it because they are all in the Held-to-maturity/transformed funding game, essentially avoiding to pay the Central Bank (and therefore the Sovereign) the liquidity premium they should pay.

    Charles - my point is simply that trying to enforce such a rule is incredibly difficult in practise. You can hide leverage off the balance sheet, you can layer leverage across subsidiaries etc.

    On the MtM issue, I completely agree. The more that is marked to market the better. I wrote a post on this topic a while ago https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/02/07/mark-to-market-accounting-and-the-financial-crisis/

    assets and companies' liabilities. A perusal of the UK's sector financial balances
    suggests that in fact the corporate sector is running insufficiently large financial
    deficits. If businesses invested more, this would help households to run their
    desired surpluses whilst allowing the budget deficit to fall. (This shouldn't
    even be controversial, although the steps to be taken to cause this situation
    to occur are clearly not obvious.) If this were to happen, business' long term
    financing needs would grow, certainly exceeding households' desired long-term
    savings. \n\nUK households currently hold 83% of GDP in currency and deposits.
    Doesn't this alone make some maturity transformation inevitable, unless you want
    to look into radical moves like getting rid of govt debt?"

  content: "Anders - on the SIVs, CDOs etc think of it this way. After the advent
    of synthetic CDOs banks could essentially construct a long-tenor bond with a synthetic
    derivative layered on top, fund it with short-term repo funding, hold it on or
    off balance sheet and reap the \"returns\". This process has no size limitations.
    And given the tail-risk heavy nature of these structures, the losses come much
    later and in a catastrophic manner.  \n\nMervyn King describes it well here http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2010/speech455.pdf\n\"the
    size of the balance sheet is no longer limited by the scale of opportunities to
    lend to companies or individuals in the real economy. So-called \"financial engineering‟
    allows banks to manufacture additional assets without limit. And in the run-up
    to the crisis, they were aided and abetted in this endeavour by a host of vehicles
    and funds in the so-called shadow banking system, which in the US grew in gross
    terms to be larger than the traditional banking sector. This shadow banking system,
    as well as holding securitised debt and a host of manufactured – or \"synthetic‟
    – exposures was also a significant source of funding for the conventional banking
    system. Money market funds and other similar entities had call liabilities totalling
    over $7 trillion. And they on lent very significant amounts to banks, both directly
    and indirectly via chains of transactions.\nThis has had two consequences. First,
    the financial system has become enormously more interconnected. This means that
    promoting stability of the system as a whole using a regime of regulation of individual
    institutions is much less likely to be successful than hitherto. Maturity mismatch
    can grow through chains of transactions – without any significant amount being
    located in any one institution – a risk described many years ago by Martin Hellwig
    (Hellwig, 1995). Second, although many of these positions net out when the financial
    system is seen as a whole, gross balance sheets are not restricted by the scale
    of the real economy and so banks were able to expand at a remarkable pace.\""

    term government debt would be a great improvement; however, I am not optimistic
    that this insight will become mainstream any time soon - on the contrary, the
    DMO is congratulating itself on having one of the longest weighted-average tenors
    around.\n\nThat King piece is interesting but I don't think his account of the
    events of 2005-8 quite works. He references the expansion and then contraction
    of the financial system's balance sheet in gross terms, but presumably to a large
    extent the net movements are more relevant. It would be interesting to see a more
    'systemic' account of the period - eg one which focuses on the debit and credit
    side of the various instruments and activities. For example, it seems that the
    growth in MMMFs, which was obviously sponsored by banks, may have sucked demand
    deposits out of banks, which needed to be replaced by more risky wholesale funding
    - but I'm not sure this account is coherent.\n\nAre you interested in Mosler's

    "In a purely fiat currency regime, there is no sanctity to the term structure of government debt."

    Agreed, but then why hold out the option of longer duration gov bond issuance? Such a thing would only make sense if the bond were non liquid - like one of the ECBs sterilisation accounts. So a PF buying a 20 year bond deposits the money with the government and gets it back in 20 years - the bond is non-transferable. I wonder what rate they'd want to go for that?

    Which leads on to your point about PFs providing long term finance. The problem with this is that at real growth rates of at best sub 2%, pensions are not a viable socio-economic system.

    I think it might be wrong to assume sources of long term funding that existed during prior periods of strong real or nominal growth would exist during a period of low or no growth. Regardless of how innovative a hypothetical micro-chaos regime might be, unless the population is growing then there won't be much if any aggregate growth of the type that underpins pensions.

    My point is that saving for retirement really isn't tenable at growth rates of 0-2%.

    Regardless of what the regime is an age structure without a base of new workers that always significantly exceeds the apex of future retirees isn't going to deliver, and thus won't exist to provide long term funding.

    No, I'm saying that people will stop paying into PFs that are predicated on 7% growth (which is what all the 'illustrations of future value' assume) when it becomes clear that its a massive fiction that you can save 5% of your salary for 40 years and expect it to pay for a 20 year retirement at a decent standard of living. And that's assuming you trust such a long term savings plan not to be stolen by the government or inflated away.

    Forget about the monetary system for a moment - there is no way that a society with a huge and rising dependency ratio could possibly fund such a dream, regardless of how well managed it is. Pensions only make sense with a strongly growing population. Even that is only a necessary but not sufficient condition since an growing population must be underpinned by plenty of untapped energy resources.

    Fascinating post.

    Two points. First, the problem is you'd need some institutional reforms of pension funds and other vehicles for long-term household savings. They may not genuinely need liquid assets, but AFAICT they generally operate as if they do. And you're still going to need intermediaries, since these funds don't have the institutional capacity to deal directly with borrowers. So it seems like a nontrivial challenge to get the long-term savings of the household sector to the long-term financing needs of the household and business sector without something like banks in between. (Of course we used to have an answer to the housing part of this problem, in the form of thrifts, but we got rid of them.)

    On the other hand, there's a possible solution in definancializing a lot of these flows. I.e. instead of households owning pensions, which own government bonds, just have the government provide retirement income directly via an expanded Social Security system. Or, again, instead of firms paying profits out to households which then make long-term loans back to firms, just reduce payouts and let firms self-finance investment out of retained earnings. It's just the logical next step in your argument. If there's no maturity mismatch, and you don't see liquidity as an important goal in itself, and you don't think frequent revaluations of assets send useful market signals, then there's really no reason not to net out a lot of these flows.

    Ashwin - I think the proposal would go as follows; it's not clear to me how banks would circumvent this:
    1. institutions licensed to hold customer deposits must pay a few bps for a govt guarantee on these deposits
    2. banks may not issue any interest-bearing debt other than gteed deposits, and loans via the interbank system
    3. banks must hold loans on their own books and not sell them; they not must not hold any assets off-BS or engage in any secondary market activity

    This is not anti-private sector; those banks that do a better job of underwriting will deliver a higher ROE, etc

    this role is asset-management. In Europe for example, some AM firms have already
    started SME lending in direct competition with banks. \n\nAgain my experience
    is largely in Europe but PFs usually don't need deep liquidity a la equities,
    bonds etc. The sort of liquidity they need can easily be provided by a fund, SPV
    etc. \n\nI don't doubt that in a different regime, many of these firms will need
    to change in an institutional sense. But IMO it can happen relatively quickly
    and painlessly. It's largely a human resource realignment. \n\nMuch of this evolution
    that I'm banging on about has happened as a result of the death of defined-benefit
    pensions. Obviously if we move back to that sort of system, the incentive for
    households to save quite so much for retirement disappears. But it's hard to see
    either goats or firms adding onto their defined-benefit commitments given ageing

    contribution comes from firms paying households wages rather than profits. In
    my opinion (and there's a fair amount of research on this), incumbent firms sooner
    or later become risk-averse and stop investing in the sort of disruptive ideas
    that are needed to keep Schumpeterian product innovation going. The resilient
    solution is constant entry of new firms that threaten the incumbents and force

    @Ashwin: "I don’t mind bank-like firms trying to maturity transform – I would just prefer that they not be provided with unlimited liquidity backstops etc"

    What's wrong with unlimited liquidity backstops provided that they are accompanied by onerous capital requirements (and the credible threat, if the capital requirements are not met, to nationalise, wipe out equity and equitise junior creditors)?

  content: "@JWM\n\n\"instead of firms paying profits out to households which then
    make long-term loans back to firms, just reduce payouts and let firms self-finance
    investment out of retained earnings\"\n\nSelf-financing is already huge; I have
    heard that Brealey Myers quote a figure &gt;90% for US fixed capital formation
    which is self-funded. But is this economically desirable?\n\nI'd submit that it's
    worth focusing on the sector financial balances and what one thinks this ought
    to look like. An obvious starting point is that firms ought to have net financial
    claims on them (debt and equity) and households ought to have net financial assets,
    representing those claims. (Govt normally also has some debt outstanding providing
    assets to HH but people don't seem to think govt debt is a good idea.)\n\nThe
    way I look at this is that the financial sector has promoted greater financialisation
    of households, with a greater expectation that one's own pot of capital will need
    to suffice to fund pensions and other contingencies, and less reliance on the
    state for these things. But for households to accumulate a larger pot of net financial
    assets relative to GDP implies that firms must be willing to run a larger financial
    deficit, raising capital to fund investment over and above their retained earnings.
    \n\nI see a tension here: households spending less by definition worsens the outlook
    for firms, lowering their willingness to drive fixed capital formation. Perhaps
    this is a relevant way to analyse the ballooning govt debt in the last couple
    of years, as bridging the gap between the two. \n\nOne interpretation would be
    that we should reverse household financialisation, increasing state pension provision
    (in line with your suggestion) and thus making households spend more out of current
    income; this would help to spur fixed capital formation, which is probably a better
    equilibrium for long-term GDP growth."

    Ashwin,

    Fully agree with everything you say here. What is doubtful, of course, is the idea that if we just remove the regulatory support for maturity transformation, then the resulting system (with lots of small bank failures and lots of new ones starting up) will be economically efficient. I think I'd be spending way to much of my time monitoring the health of the available banks and shifting funds around. Doesn't sound like fun.

    What government needs to do is to extend the central bank services to all citizens and corporations. More than adequate money supply could be created simply by investors repoing their liquid assets (there'd be lots of bank bonds and equity!) with a *very* safe haircut (e.g. 70% for liquid stocks, 50% for liquid corporate/bank bonds, 1%-20% for government bonds depending on maturity) at the CB. Creation of money does *not* require maturity transformation of illiquid assets. Repoing liquid ones will do the trick. Also, if everybody is using central bank money we'd need *way less* of it. That's because settlements could be carried out much, much faster than the abysmal current system of interbank cheque clearing.

    going to be a demand for risk free loans. This is principally repo loans from
    low risk tolerance to high risk tolerance agents. And the central bank can always
    set that rate. And that's the rate that determines the whole risk free term structure.

    "Scepticus: I think I can see how in a world where the provision of credit is inextricably linked with goods transactions, we can no longer speak of a market for credit."

    I am thinking of a case where Siemens, a bank, and also an industrial conglomerate, wishes to shift some white goods.

    They will extend credit to both their retail channel and the end consumer who buys their products, at an interest rate they see fit, regardless of what the CB thinks is a suitable base rate.

    At the same time they would net credit with their suppliers. A circular route from a supplier owed credit and a consumer who owes siemens might easily be found and netted without going via the CB, and even if it did go via the CB it needn't use the official rate.

    As for systems I have outlined - I wasn't aware I had outlined one. I merely pointed out that any and all transactions not needing *significant* maturity transformation (say beyond one or two years) need not go via intermediaries and can be directly peer-2-peer hence removing any scope for centralised control of the terms and conditions of those credit agreements.

    I doubt it. They may charge less than the risk free rate but add the cost of that to the sale price. But if the risk free rate goes up, the cost of loans will follow. Otherwise Siemens is stupid since they could lend for more elsewhere. Independently, there's a minimum price they'll sell at and a minimum rate they'll lend at (which is above the risk free rate). If the sale and the loan are bundled together, you can split the saleprice and the rate any number of ways without changing the NPV of the transaction. But there's no way you'll buy the product at cost and get a loan below the risk free rate, or the seller is allowing themselves to be arbitraged.

    If the vast majority of siemens' profits come from selling industrial and consumer goods then what it makes from lending is immaterial. As I have pointed out twice now, they are only lending in order to shift their goods.

    What you seem to be suggesting is that a series of fully dis-intermdiated non-bank firms will somehow in aggregate obey the wishes of the CB that they reduce their profits below best. I cam't see why a rise in the risk free rate would cause profit maximising non bank firms to reduce their volume of sales and profits when that rate doesn't actually constitute a barrier to transacting (as it did when all firms and individuals were intermediated by banks).

<p>In many previous posts on this blog, I outlined why allowing the incumbent banks to fail when they become insolvent is a pre-requisite for achieving macroeconomic resilience. In my previous <a href="/2011/10/05/a-simple-policy-program-for-macroeconomic-resilience/">post</a> I outlined how allowing such failure can be managed without causing a deflationary economic collapse in the process. Nevertheless, there are many who believe that a no-bailouts policy is tantamount to <a href="/2011/10/05/a-simple-policy-program-for-macroeconomic-resilience/">‘financial romanticism’</a>. In criticising the no-bailouts approach, Krugman deploys three arguments:</p>
<p><strong>Policy makers will intervene anyway</strong></p>
<p>It is undeniably true that policy makers will almost certainly move to stabilise the banking sector in times of economic distress. The aim of my <a href="/2011/10/05/a-simple-policy-program-for-macroeconomic-resilience/">‘program’</a> was simply to sketch out a possible alternative that could be deployed rapidly during a crisis. Although I have some sympathy for policy makers asked to stabilise the economy during the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression, it is worth noting that the same policy of implicit and explicit support has been extended to failing banks at almost every point since WW2 - even in many instances when the fallout would have been much smaller. It is this prolonged stabilisation that has left us with such a fragile financial system.</p>
<p><strong>Are guarantees and safety net plus regulation the only feasible strategy?</strong></p>
<p>I have no disagreement with the argument that <em>“ bank regulation is important even in the absence of bailouts”</em>. There are many industries which are regulated simply for the purposes of protecting their customers and banking is no different. However I disagree strongly with the notion that regulation can prevent the abuse of these guarantees. The history of banking is one of repeated circumvention of regulations by banks, a process that has only accelerated with the increased <a href="/category/category/complete-markets/">completeness of markets</a>. Just because deregulation may have accelerated the extraction of the moral hazard subsidy (which it almost certainly did) does not imply that re-regulation can solve the problem. Banks now have at their disposal the ability to engineer synthetic exposures tailored to maximise rent extraction - the <a href="/2009/11/06/a-rational-explanation-of-the-financial-crisis/">‘synthetic CDO super-senior tranche’</a> that was at the heart of the losses in the investment banks in 2008 was one such invention. It is the completeness of this menu of options that banks possess to game regulations that distinguishes banking from other regulated industries. Minsky was well aware of the impact of financial innovation on the resilience of the financial system which is why he <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9eSu2F4CKNkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=minsky%20john%20maynard%20keynes&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">understood</a> that the so-called golden age of the 50s and the 60s was <em>“an accident of history, which was due to the financial residue of World War 2 following fast upon a great depression”</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Maturity Transformation and the Diamond-Dybvig framework</strong></p>
<p>The core rationale of the <a href="http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~allenf/download/crises/Diamond-Dybvig83.pdf">Diamond-Dybvig framework</a> is that banks are susceptible to self-fulfilling runs due to their unstable balance sheet comprising of long-maturity illiquid assets and on-demand liquid liabilities i.e. deposits. The implicit rationale is that maturity transformation has a beneficial impact. As William Dudley <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2009/dud091113.html">explains</a> it, <em>“the need for maturity transformation arises from the fact that the preferred habitat of borrowers tends toward longer-term maturities used to finance long-lived assets such as a house or a manufacturing plant, compared with the preferred habitat of investors, who generally have a preference to be able to access their funds quickly. Financial intermediaries act to span these preferences, earning profits by engaging in maturity transformation—borrowing shorter-term in order to finance longer-term lending”</em>.</p>
<p>But what if there is no maturity mismatch for banks to intermediate? In a previous <a href="/2010/10/21/questioning-the-benefits-of-maturity-transformation/">post</a> I have argued that <em>“structural changes in the economy have drastically reduced and even possibly eliminated the need for society to promote and subsidise maturity transformation.”</em> The primary change in this regard is the increasing assets invested in pension funds and life insurers. Through these vehicles, households provide capital that strongly prefers long-maturity investments that match its long-tenor liabilities.</p>
<p>But how significant is this phenomenon and what does it mean for the economy-wide mismatch? In a recent research report, Patrick Artus at Natixis <a href="http://cib.natixis.com/flushdoc.aspx?id=59750">dug out</a> the relevant numbers which I have summarised below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/Maturity-Mismatch.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015" title="Maturity Mismatch" src="/images/Maturity-Mismatch.png" alt="" width="322" height="420" /></a></p>
<p>In both the United States and Europe, household long-term savings (which includes pensions) is more than sufficient to meet the long-term borrowing needs of both the corporate and the household sector. In the case of the United States which issues its own currency, the need for maturity transformation can simply be eliminated by adjusting the government debt maturity profile accordingly. It is worth noting that even a significant proportion of the government debt in the above table is of a fairly short maturity.</p>
<p>The expansion that ended in 2008 was characterised by an expansion in the volume of long-term credit investments, but as Lord Adair Turner <a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/speeches/031611_at.pdf">observed</a>, in the United Kingdom <em>“only a small proportion of those ended up in the balance sheets of long term hold-to-maturity investors such as pension funds or insurance companies. Instead the majority of UK residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in particular were held by investing institutions, such as SIVs and mutual funds, behind which stood – at the end of the chain – short-term investors.”</em> As Minsky might have predicted, maturity transformation was simply a tool to enter into a levered carry trade at the taxpayers’ expense.</p>
<p><strong>In a world where maturity transformation does not even improve the efficiency of the economic system, Diamond-Dybvig and much of the rationale for our current banking and monetary system simply do not hold.</strong> The implications of this are not that we must ban maturity transformation. As Rajiv Sethi <a href="http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/william-dudley-and-hyman-minsky-on.html">points out</a>, even non-banking firms engage in maturity transformation and any attempt to stamp it out is futile. However, it is crucial that firms (banks or otherwise) that engage in maturity transformation are allowed to fail when they run into trouble.</p>
