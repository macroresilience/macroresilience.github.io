    But how can one raise the price (interest rate) and supply (quantity) simultaneously?

    Or is the argument that these sterilized helicopter drops don't change the equilibrium quantity of money? Or that they raise quantity but lower velocity? In which case what are they doing?

    It's all very unclear.

  content: "Yup, good point. Just pay IOR and the CB can control quantity and the
    short rate independently. But with two instruments shouldn't they have two targets?
    It would make sense to me to use helicopter drops to target consumer credit conditions
    and the policy rate for inflation. I think this would create incentives to better
    avoid bubble lending, since creditors would know that any resulting crash would
    result in a wealth transfer to debtors. Also, rather than exiting a recession
    by using lower rates in order to try to drive releveraging, we'd actually deleverage
    troubled balance sheets. \n\nYou could also target inequality directly instead
    of credit, via the helicopter drop. That doesn't seem right to me for the simple
    reason that issues of equity should be settled democratically, via fiscal policy
    and regulation. Dysfunctional credit conditions, on the other hand, are unequivocally
    an impediment to market efficiency and are therefore reasonably the domain of
    the central bank. \n\nA decent relevant framework for analysing this problem is
    Eggertsson Krugman (2010) which clearly showed that you need fiscal transfers
    as well as interest rate fiscal policy to get efficient outcomes when some agents
    are credit constrained. It's not a surprising result since every efficiency result
    that's ever been produced depends on all all agents having equal and unlimited
    access to credit."

  content: "Ashwin,\n\n\"In a world where interest rates are still subject to the
    zero bound, is it not worthwhile to use heli-drops to target inflation as well?\"\n\nYes.
    But the big shocks that take us to the ZLB seem to be credit/balance sheet shocks.
    If we target a 5% nominal rate under normal conditions there are very few real
    shocks that can lower the natural rate by 5% as far as I can tell. But EK (2010)
    finds an optimal mix of both that is definitely affected by the existence of the
    ZLB. So you are right that you can't exclusively assign fiscal policy to non-output
    gap measures. But I suspect that if you deal with financial crises, the rest *could*
    (not necessarily should) for the most part be solved with interest rates.\n\n\n\"I’m
    not really in favour of targeting inequality thru heli-drops – send the same amount
    of money to everybody.\"\n\nBut even if you send the same amount to everyone you
    are reducing inequality. Anyways, my point was irrelevant. It has no impact on
    the top end of the distribution. Monetary policy really can't directly do much
    about *that* kind of inequality.\n\nI do think it's worth trying to flesh out
    exactly what you'd like to target, though. As you say, you could do unlimited
    helicopter drops without inflation if you just raise the short rate appropriately.
    So how much inflation-neutral heli-drops should you do? Eventually you are surely
    just using fiscal policy to favour consumption and crowd out investment. What
    does the economy look like in the limit of extreme heli-drops equilibrated by
    high rates? Is there something good there? Certainly more equality. But assuming
    you don't want to go there, what *is* it that we are targeting with our dual instruments?
    Inflation is one thing, but what's the other? \n\nThe way I see it, it seems possible
    that you are causing a big dead weight loss if your inflation-neutral heli-drop
    is raising the real rate more than it is reducing credit spreads for the bulk
    of consumers. I.e. you should be trying to reduce, not increase market lending
    rates. This is why I think you might want to use your heli-drop to influence credit
    spreads, or rather minimize all-in consumer lending rates. And leave short rate
    policy for inflation (except near the ZLB). \n\n\"But having this option will
    also allow the CB/govt to allow some bubbles to burst, allow banks to fail without
    having to bail them out etc safe in the knowledge that they can counter the possibility
    of a deflationary collapse with heli-drops. This alone should reduce inequality
    significantly across cycles.\"\n\nAgreed. But would the collapse ever even occur
    if the CB continuously heli-drops to constrained consumers (everyone equally,
    of course, but those are the relevant balance sheets) to keep demand on target?
    Also, by backstopping consumers, do you backstop consumer lending? Is that dangerous?
    How do banks fail systematically if consumers keep paying? \n\nThese are not rhetorical
    questions, BTW - I haven't thought it through yet. As you know, I'm not a big
    fan of the current monetary set up, and I'm moderately suspicious that instabilities
    can be fixed efficiently via heli-drops."

    One more way to think about it...

    We've been ignoring the impact of heli-drops on government debt. So long as the real rate is below the growth rate, we don't have to put government debt in the utility function at all, since we never have to pay it off (in fact the economy is "dynamically inefficient": we might *gain* utility by adding government debt). But if you do *a lot* of inflation controlled heli-drops (ICHD), the real rate rises and growth drops.  If we had NGDP futures then it would make sense to use ICHDs to control the spread between forward interest rates and forward NGDP, just to make sure we are keeping the economy just on the right side of dynamically inefficient. Anyways, I don't think this goal would be very inconsistent with trying to lower all-in borrowing costs.

    Maybe we should think of this as LBOing the government. The government is sitting on cash (super low borrowing costs) and refusing to do anything with it. So we lever them up and pay a big dividend to the owners (citizens) who have plenty of good use for the cash, thereby restoring the dynamically efficient amount of leverage. Are MMTers really just "barbarians at the gates" of government? Maybe we should have put Mitt Romney in charge!

    Might work in the US. Probably more problematic in the UK or small open economies.

    "Holders of money and holders of bonds only care about real interest rates"  The marginal tax rate may have a significant impact as the nominal interest rate is taxed; saw this in the 70s.

  content: "K - Thanks for the comments! A lot for me to chew on.\n\nFirstly, yes
    there is a discussion to be had on all the issues you raised and it is a discussion
    we need to have. The immediate trigger for this post was the fact that so many
    people seem to think that these \"ICHDs\" are literally impossible and/or incoherent.
    \n\nYou say \"if you deal with financial crises, the rest *could* (not necessarily
    should) for the most part be solved with interest rates.\" I tend to agree. \nLet
    me try and explain my thinking on heli-drops. I see them largely as a temporary
    medicine, the use of which has been made necessary by the monetary and banking
    mismanagement of the last 30 years. If we'd been willing to live with a few minor
    recessions and banking/market failures during this period, we almost certainly
    wouldn't be where we are. Even in 2008/2009 if we'd had the courage to use heli-drops
    instead of propping up the TBTF banks, we'd be better off now.\n\nYour point on
    inequality is obviously correct and yes I meant it in the sense that the amounts
    involved in the heli-drop aren't really going to matter to the 1%. \n\nYou said
    \"it seems possible that you are causing a big dead weight loss if your inflation-neutral
    heli-drop is raising the real rate more than it is reducing credit spreads for
    the bulk of consumers\"\nThe way I see the current environment - the market and
    the financial sector are out of the woods, credit spreads and financing conditions
    for most large firms and others with access to the bond market are back to normal.
    But financing conditions for small businesses and households are still constrained.
    In my opinion, the loss from raising the bank rate will be far exceeded by the
    improvement in the household balance sheet from the heli-drop itself. Households
    and small businesses are anyway paying a far higher credit spread today than they
    were not just pre-crisis during the bubble but even in more normal times. \n\nYou
    said \"by backstopping consumers, do you backstop consumer lending? Is that dangerous?
    How do banks fail systematically if consumers keep paying?\" Excellent point and
    I've debated this with others. To avoid this problem, there is no doubt that the
    heli-drop money must not be available to banks in case of default/bankruptcy etc.
    This combined with the uncertain nature of the help-drop should be sufficient
    to prevent this \"generalised moral hazard\". Incidentally this is why I don't
    support schemes such as a high universal basic income  - as an ex-banker, I'm
    certain that banks will find some way to transform such a certain payment into
    increased borrowing in some manner no matter what the law says. \n\nYou said \"If
    we had NGDP futures then it would make sense to use ICHDs to control the spread
    between forward interest rates and forward NGDP, just to make sure we are keeping
    the economy just on the right side of dynamically inefficient.\" That is an intriguing
    thought and one that I need to think about a lot more before I can respond. \n\nYou
    said \"Maybe we should think of this as LBOing the government. The government
    is sitting on cash (super low borrowing costs) and refusing to do anything with
    it. So we lever them up and pay a big dividend to the owners (citizens) who have
    plenty of good use for the cash, thereby restoring the dynamically efficient amount

    be your best comment yet!"

  content: "Ashwin,\n\n\"In my opinion, the loss from raising the bank rate will be
    far exceeded by the improvement in the household balance sheet from the heli-drop
    itself.\"\n\nBecause household credit spreads will decline more than the real
    rate will rise? Or do you also consider the utility of the extra wealth? I.e.
    is it enough to just target lowering all-in borrowing costs or is it OK to raise
    all-in borrowing costs *a bit* if it's offset by a big gain in consumer wealth?
    My point was that we could just task the CB with lowering all-in borrowing costs
    and let them ignore the utility enhancing effects of improved wealth distribution.
    I.e. they should only do ICHDs if credit spreads for the representative household
    are reduced more than real rates rise. \n\n\"there is no doubt that the heli-drop
    money must not be available to banks in case of default/bankruptcy\"\n\nYes, good
    point. But I don't agree that the same measures won't work for a citizen's dividend.
    Maybe banks will succeed in garnishing more wage income if there is a universal
    payment. So be it. People should learn not to deal with banks. The main thing
    is that you can't be destitute just because you are unlucky or even incompetent.
    No matter what, what banks can or cannot lay claim to shouldn't be an argument
    against a citizen's dividend. If you can create a universal income you can also
    change the bankruptcy laws. \n\n\"Thanks for the comments!\" \n\nThanks for the
    posts! I do wonder why you don't get one tenth of the comments you deserve. In

    Ashwin is right. Again.\" and it seems trite to just say that. It seems the blogs

    or inflammatory. Who knows. I suspect you'd get more traffic if you tried starting
    off a few posts with \"So and so is a moron...\" Especially pick on somebody with
    a lot of good commenters (e.g. Steve Waldman, Nick Rowe or Brad Delong). I do

  content: "Ashwin,\n\n\"so yes I do consider the utility of the extra wealth.\"\n\nIf
    the economy is growing at 5% nominal then I suppose there is 5% or so monetary
    growth to be earned as seignorage for somebody. Might as well pay that to the
    public. But if you try to drop more money than an efficient amount in pursuit
    a utility optimizing wealth distribution, there will be a cost to be paid in terms
    of a rise in the real rate which will inefficiently favour consumption at the
    expense of investment. While flat payments are the right benefit, I don't think
    raising the real rate is the right \"tax\" to effect the wealth distribution.
    In fact, I think it's probably *less* efficient than a bit of surprise inflation.
    So if you are going to use monetary policy to effect a wealth transfer I don't
    think you should control inflation. \n\nBut I doubt that inflation is a good tax
    either. Wealth transfers are better financed via efficient taxation like land
    or externalities like carbon. Or by targeting the monopoly rents that drive profits
    and depress wages in the first place. Surprise inflation or high real rates are
    low on my list of good redistribution measures.\n\n\"And I’m not sure the argument
    for helidrops is as robust if we ignore it.\"\n\nSurely it isn't, but it's still
    very strong. Like you said, we would never have had deficient demand, even in
    08/09, if we'd had heli-drops. And I don't think you will get anywhere trying
    to convince people that central banks should have an equality target. There are
    better ways of addressing inequality and it's risky to use a good policy to address
    the wrong goal. If you just stick to efficiency arguments you are way more likely
    to get your policy implemented. \n\n\"I’m not really cut out to write inflammatory

    Since the beta of growth is closer to 1 than to 0, r&lt;g for govt bonds does not imply dynamic inefficiency at all. Fiscal equilibrium can have r&lt;g forever, with the govt running a moderate primary deficit forever depending on the amount of govt debt investors are willing to hold on to.

    Phelps/Diamond raised it in the 60s, Tobin provided the resolution in the early 70s, almost dismissing the idea of dynamic efficiency as nothing more than a theoretical curiosity in a world with risk.

    Apart from that, great comments!

    \ The Fed would credit drop-recipient deposit accounts, which is the same thing
    as issuing reserves (liability).  Against the reserves there is no asset.  Therefore
    the Fed would take an immediate loss.  Since Fed remittances form part of fiscal

    I suppose from an 'efficiency' perspective, a helicopter drop is predicated upon the contention that the current *natural* real rate is unnaturally low. So we wish to raise that rate w/o doing much with the market real rate, or even allowing the market real rate to increase, because we suspect that even at current real rates, the market threatens to run into financial instability/gold or land trap issues.

    If we don't make that contention, then difficult to see why the first-best policy is not simply a higher inflation target. The helicopter drop then needs to be argued on a plank of - this is the only/best way to achieve inflation, which may be a more difficult argument to make.

    Of course, there's the small matter of fiscal distributional neutrality/progressivity on top. Even if we place a small individual probability on each of the three reasons mentioned above, the overall case for heli drops becomes quite compelling. Which is why I'm in favour and have always been since SRW's post many months back.

  content: "Ritwik,\n\n\"Since the beta of growth is closer to 1 than to 0, r&lt;g
    for govt bonds does not imply dynamic inefficiency at all&quot;\n\nThe Tobin paper
    provides lots of good reasons why r might be less than g. The reasons include
    anything that might induce people to care more about the near over the distant
    future including liquidity constrained consumers, those who are childless or for
    whatever reason don&#039;t care as much about the welfare of their descendants
    as they do about their own. But none of these in any way refute the fact that
    the resulting outcome is, in fact, inefficient.\n\nAn important observation of
    modern portfolio theory is that if you have a large number of independent investments,
    a portfolio of such investments should earn the risk-free rate because you can
    completely eliminate all risk via diversification. This result is true in general
    to the extent that the individual returns satisfy the assumptions of the central
    limit theorem. If the expected return of that portfolio is greater than r then
    we have a &quot;static&quot; inefficiency. The contribution of the CAPM was that
    individual investments could not earn above r *except* to the extent that they
    are exposed to undiversifiable (systemic) risk factors. \n\nBut CAPM (and all
    of early MPT) was a single period model. The difficulty with extending it to the
    multi-period setting is that if the individual periods are long enough, income
    in each period will be independent and so an agent that can diversify through
    an arbitrarily long period of time has statistically vanishing income risk. So
    your statement doesn&#039;t make much sense to me: the &quot;beta&quot; of various
    income sources in any given period is irrelevant. It is the correlation between
    different *time periods* that matters. It&#039;s very non-trivial to make infinitely
    lived agents demand *any* risk premium whatsoever from their investments. \n\nSo
    *if* r&lt;g (and Tobin gives us lots of good reasons to think that it might be)
    then government could provide any payment whatsoever to current agents and pay
    for it via any *arbitrarily small* annual income tax. You might argue that it
    is not *pareto* optimal to take anything, no matter how small, from future agents
    and give it to current agents. I might agree, but in that case you only have to
    invest a bit of the wealth transfer in order to produce any arbitrarily small
    improvement in g in order to make the trade pareto optimal. Sounds to me like
    a *massive* inefficiency no matter how you define it.\n\nFrom this perspective
    there is no doubt that government should borrow and spend. The only question is
    how much to consume and how much to invest. That depends on how much you think
    government should represent current versus future citizens. I think you can make
    a strong philosophical case that government should optimize over all citizens,
    present and future, which would tend to favour a large investment in education
    and R&amp;D over current consumption."

    Ritwik,

    "I suppose from an ‘efficiency’ perspective, a helicopter drop is predicated upon the contention that the current *natural* real rate is unnaturally low"

    Sort of. I'd say it's predicated on very standard theory which says that you shouldn't expect an efficient equilibrium if agents don't all have equal access to borrowing, i.e. are unable to monetize their wealth.  Yes, that depresses the natural rate, but the inefficiency is the direct consequence of the illiquidity. Now you might be able to raise the natural rate without alleviating the ultimate cause of the inefficiency, if you could just bring back the confidence fairy. And maybe that would reignite lending. But the purpose of the heli-drop is to solve the actual consumer balance sheet problem in as direct a manner as possible.

    Now some inequality of access to credit is a necessary condition of people learning the consequences of their own bad decisions. But systemic lack of access serves disproportionately as punishment to borrowers for mistakes made by lenders. A heli-drop both restores market efficiency and inflicts a relative wealth loss on lenders, a lesson which they thoroughly deserve.

    Ritwik,

    “For an infinitely lived agent/economy, p(undiversifiable systemic risk) tends to 0. ”

    The St-Petersburg paradox says you can make a finite return with probability one if you are willing to wager an unbounded amount of capital doubling up on an unbiased coin. It's a dumb result: if you phrase it as the limit of the expected *return/risk* (rather than dollars) after n coin flips, the result is zero. It's not asking a relevant question.

    *But*

    If it's a biased coin with an expected log-return of g-r then flipping it t times gives you an expected total log-return of (g-r)t. As t gets big, the realized annual return tends to g-r with probability one so long as g_i-r_i are independent and have uniformly bounded variance. I.e. the probability of getting an annual return smaller than g-r by any epsilon tends to zero as t gets large. After a finite number of steps, the probability of crossing back to a loss is *exactly* zero on many paths. And the fraction of paths for which that is true tends to 1 as t gets large.

    Since the return/risk ratio is infinite and government is infinitely lived, the government will have no trouble trouble borrowing at r for as long as it takes to win at this trade. There is simply no credit risk in lending to the government.

    Now you might reasonably ask, if these variables are independent with known mean, then what is the mean? The answer is I don't know, but we assumed that the mean g is greater than the mean r, i.e. E[g_i-r_i]&gt;0. That is all I need to make my case. If r begins to exceed g and this occurs at some point in the future that is not so far away that exp(gt) &gt;&gt; exp(rt), then we have to worry about it. But if we assume that g&gt;r (and we did), then that is all we need to know.

    Thinking it over that isn't true. What is true is that for any path in a state of profit, there is a positive probability of never even temporarily touching below zero again and as t increases that probability tends to one for a fraction of paths which also tends to one. The rest stands.

    For what it's worth:

    "What may be needed is a method of directly controlling inflation that do not interfere with free market adjustments in relative prices or rely on unemployment to keep inflation in check ... Trying to control an economy in three major macroeconomic dimensions with only two instruments is like trying to fly an airplane with elevator and rudder but no ailerons...

    One possible third control measure would be a system of marketable rights to value added, (or "gross markups") issued to firms enjoying limited liability, proportioned to the prime factors employed, such as labor and capital, with an aggregate face value corresponding to the overall market value of the output at a programmed overall price level. Firms encountering a specially favorable market could realize a higher than normal level of markups only by purchasing rights from firms less favorably situated. The market value of the rights would vary automatically so as to apply the correct downward pressure on markups to produce the desired overall price level. A suitable penalty tax would be levied on any firm found to have had value added in excess of the warrants held."

    Ritwik,

    Alright, I don't actually totally disagree about tail risk. But we *did* assume that g&gt;r. You are really threading a pretty fine needle if you want to insist that we can know the first moment but the second is undefined (and you should have told me that upfront!). What distribution, exactly, do you have in mind? I think you are violating the *spirit* of the debate.

    "And of course, then r is not the rate of government financing."

    Why isn't it? If government has the power to tax it can borrow at the risk free real rate. So long as government *can* borrow (and it certainly can) and r&lt;g, it is foregoing a pareto improving trade that only it can carry out (nobody else can confiscate a fraction of future income). That&#039;s inefficient.

    that assumption of g&gt;r was purely for the first moment, I thought that my argument
    around 'the beta of growth is 1' sort-of captured that. My current favourite resolution
    of the equity premium puzzle is the Barro catastrophic risk one, and that's how
    I think of economic growth itself. Perhaps I should have brought that out earlier.\n\nI
    think I may have created confusion when I agreed to debate in terms of an infinitely
    lived agent or economy. Perhaps an infinitely lived economy is irreconcilable
    with the idea of catastrophic risk.\n\nI'm not going to suggest a specific distribution
    - that would be unqualified overstatement on my part. I trust that my previous
    clarifications ensure that I'm not violating the spirit of the debate.\n\nI sense
    that you're thinking I'm making a case for the government not borrowing/ not borrowing
    more generally or currently. I'm not. I'm just saying that the statement:\n\n\"a
    government should borrow until the rate of interest on its liability (assume only
    one kind of sovereign bond) exceeds the expected growth rate of the economy by
    epsilon\"\n\nis false.\n\nThe government is surely the only entity that can confiscate
    a fraction of future income. But the government is also an entity that can make
    its bondholders whole without confiscating a *set* fraction of aggregate future
    income. It can, for example, forego spending. You may say that this is equivalent
    to confiscating income, but it is not - spending foregone does not have to bear
    any relation to the *aggregate* level/rate of GDP/growth. It could do a helicopter
    drop on bondholders.\n\ng is a factor in whether/how bondholders get paid, but
    it does not constrain it. g is risky, r(sovereign) is not. The fiscal-financial-monetary
    complex of the government sets the financial numeraire, or perhaps even the term
    structure of financial numeraires. Consumption/income is uncertain. A government
    that treats the numeraire as equivalent to aggregate/average consumption has essentially
    foregone the act of creating a numeraire.\n\nr, in the sense of inter-temporal
    consumption equilibrium may perhaps be mirrored best - assuming financial equilibrium
    - by say the yield on 10 yr BAAs, or something similar. \n\nIn a steady state,
    dynamically efficient economy where the government is borrowing exactly right,
    I'd expect r(govvies) &lt; g &lt; r(BAA)."

    within relatively standard economic theory, in which the choice of numeraire is
    irrelevant. The reason the *real* rate is important in standard theory is that

    is expected to persist *forever* then that loan becomes a heli-drop. So in general,
    the representative household&#039;s borrowing costs should be similar to government
    (a bit higher due to idiosyncratic risk - but systemic household balance sheet
    problems are just stupid). And the blended average funding cost should be similar

<p>I am a strong advocate of <a href="/2011/10/05/a-simple-policy-program-for-macroeconomic-resilience/">helicopter drops</a> as the <a href="/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/">primary</a> and first-choice tool of macroeconomic stabilisation. There is increasing <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9bcf0eea-6f98-11e2-b906-00144feab49a.html#axzz2KtXHSk5t">debate</a> about helicopter drops but almost everyone assumes that helicopter money is just another way to generate higher inflation. Those who fear inflation see helicopter drops as irresponsible and those who seek more inflation see helicopter drops as irrelevant and equivalent to asset purchases by the central bank. Both these views are wrong -<strong> helicopter drops can be implemented without any change in inflation so long as interest rates are hiked to counteract the inflationary impact of helicopter money.</strong> Let me take a simple example to illustrate how - if the UK government were to send a sum of £500 to each British resident and financed this transfer via monetary financing from the Bank of England, the Bank of England in turn could simply hike the base rate till the inflationary impact of the helicopter drop was negated.</p>
<p>Even if helicopter drops did lead to higher inflation, the <a href="/2013/01/07/on-the-folly-of-inflation-targeting-in-a-world-of-interest-bearing-money/">inflation target</a> does not matter in a world of <a href="/2012/10/17/monetary-and-fiscal-economics-for-a-near-credit-economy/">interest-bearing money</a>. Holders of money and holders of bonds only care about real interest rates. If helicopter drops result in inflation going up from 3% to 5% and interest rates going from 0.50% to 2.50%, then money-holders are no better or worse off.</p>
