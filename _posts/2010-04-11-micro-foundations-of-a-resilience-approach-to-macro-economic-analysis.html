    Thanks very much for sharing these thoughts. It's troubled me that the standard representative agent models in macro have yet really to come to terms with Knightian uncertainty. This post helped a lot to untangle some thoughts that have occurred to me in at most only a vague, inarticulate form.

    Have you applied this analysis to theories about the '87 crash? It seems a sudden jolt, whatever the origin, that somehow triggers radical updating of expectations could help account for the cascading plunge in markets.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Before  assessing whether a resilience approach is relevant to macro-economic  analysis, we need to define resilience. Resilience is best <a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/">defined as</a> </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"the capacity of a system to absorb  disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still  retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and  feedbacks."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The  assertion that an ecosystem can lose resilience and become fragile is  not controversial. To claim that the same can occur in social systems  such as macro-economies is nowhere near as obvious, not least due to our  ability to learn, forecast the future and adapt to changes in our  environment. Any analysis of how social systems can lose resilience is  open to the objection that loss of resilience implies systematic error  on the part of economic actors in assessing the economic conditions  accurately and an inability to adapt to the new reality. For example,  one of the common objections to </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Minsky's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH) is that it requires irrational  behaviour on the part of economic actors. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rajiv</span></span> <span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sethi's</span></span> <a href="http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/12/economics-of-hyman-minsky.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">post</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> has a summary of this debate with a  notable objection coming from </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bernanke's</span></span> <a href="http://econ.arts.ubc.ca/paterson/econ532/10twenties/bernanke.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">paper</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> on the subject which insists that</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hyman</span></em></span><em> </em><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Minsky</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and Charles </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kindleberger</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> have in several places argued for  the inherent instability of the financial system, but in doing so have  had to depart from the assumption of rational behavior." </span></em></span></p>

However, I am  going to focus on a third and a more broadly applicable rationale which  utilises a "rationality" that incorporates Knightian uncertainty as the  basis for the FIH. <strong>The existence of irreducible uncertainty is  sufficient to justify an evolutionary approach for any social system,  whether it be an </strong></span></span><strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">organization</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> or a macro-economy. </span></span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Think of an omniscient agent with literally no uncertainty in  identifying the most preferred action under any conceivable condition,  regardless of the complexity of the environment which he encounters.  Intuitively, such an agent would benefit from maximum flexibility to use  all potential information or to adjust to all environmental conditions,  no matter how rare or subtle those conditions might be. But what if  there is uncertainty because agents are unable to decipher all of the  complexity of the environment? Will allowing complete flexibility still  benefit the agents? </span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I believe the  general answer to this question is negative: that when genuine  uncertainty exists, allowing greater flexibility to react to more  information or administer a more complex repertoire of actions will not  necessarily enhance an agent's performance."</span></em></span></p>

But perhaps the clearest exposition of the idea was provided  by Kenneth </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Boulding</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in his description of subjective  human knowledge as an </span></span><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w11X66GwvNIC"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">'Image'</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Most external information either  conforms so closely to the image that it is ignored or it adds to the  image in a well-defined manner. But occasionally, we receive information  that is at odds with our image. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Boulding</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> recognised that such change is usually abrupt and explained it in the  following manner: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"The sudden and dramatic nature of these </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">reorganizations</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> is perhaps a result of the fact  that our image is in itself resistant to change. When it receives  messages which conflict with it, its first impulse is to reject them as  in some sense untrue....As we continue to receive messages which  contradict our image, however, we begin to have doubts, and then one day  we receive a message which overthrows our previous image and we revise  it completely."</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> He also recognises that this resistance is not "irrational" but merely a  logical response to uncertainty in an "imperfect" market.</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "The buyer or seller in an  imperfect market drives on a mountain highway where he cannot see more  than a few feet around each curve; he drives it, moreover, in a dense  fog. There is little wonder, therefore, that he tends not to drive it at  all but to stay where he is. The well-known stability or stickiness of  prices in imperfect markets may have much more to do with the uncertain  nature of the image involved than with any ideal of maximizing  behavior."</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Loasby</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> describes the key principles of this  framework as follows: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"The first principle is that all action is decided in the space  of representations. These representations include, for example, neural  networks formed in the brain by processes which are outside our  conscious control...None are direct copies of reality; all truncate  complexity and suppress uncertainty......The second principle of this  inquiry is that viable processes must operate within viable boundaries;  in human affairs these boundaries limit our attention and our procedures  to what is manageable without, we hope, being disastrously misleading -  though no guarantees are available......The third principle is that  these frameworks are useless unless they persist, even when they do not  fit very well. Hahn's definition of equilibrium as a situation in which  the messages received by agents do not cause them to change the theories  that they hold or the policies that they pursue offers a useful  framework for the analysis both of individual behaviour and of the  co-ordination of economic activity across a variety of circumstances  precisely because it is not to be expected that theories and policies  will be readily changed just because some evidence does not appear  readily compatible with them." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(For a more detailed account, read Chapter 3 'Cognition and  Institutions' of the aforementioned </span></span><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hCGRa9DWHWsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">book</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> or his papers </span></span><a href="ftp://papers.econ.mpg.de/evo/discussionpapers/2005-13.pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">here</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and </span></span><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.115.6718&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">here</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The above principles are similar to  Ronald </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Heiner's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> assertion that actions chosen under  true uncertainty must satisfy a 'reliability condition'. It also  accounts for the existence of the stability-resilience trade-off. In </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Loasby's</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> words: </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"If behaviour is a selected  adaptation and not a specific application of a general logic of choice,  then the introduction of substantial novelty - a change not of weather  but of climate - is liable to be severely disruptive, as </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schumpeter</span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> also insisted. In biological  systems it can lead to the extinction of species, sometimes on a very  large scale." </span></em></span><strong><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Extended  periods of stability narrow the scope of events that fit the script  and correspondingly broaden the scope of events that appear to be anomalous and novel. When the inevitable anomalous event comes along,  we either adapt too slowly or in extreme cases, not at all. </span></span></strong></p>
