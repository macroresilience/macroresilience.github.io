<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It  was only a matter of time given the focus on the </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goldman</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">-SEC case before someone decided to apportion some  of the blame onto the ratings agencies. And sure enough, the New York  Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/business/24rating.html">story</a> out on how the ratings agencies were an integral part  of the problem because they gave banks free access to their models and ratings  methodology. But this is true of all banking  regulations - banking regulators too make their rules, models and  methodology freely available to banks who then proceed to arbitrage  these rules, primarily to minimise the capital that they are required to  hold. </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is  not surprising given that ratings agencies are essentially an </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">outsourced</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> function of the banking regulatory  apparatus.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> And  the problem of arbitrage is also well-known - I have referred to it as  the </span></span><a href="../category/goodharts-law/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Goodhart's</span></span></span></span></a><a href="../category/goodharts-law/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Law</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of financial regulation.</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The NYT article implicitly suggests that increasing  the opacity and ambiguity around the ratings methodology would have  resulted in a better outcome. This is similar to how </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Google</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> tries to discourage people from trying to  arbitrage its search algorithm by keeping it </span></span><a href="http://atomiq.org/archives/2008/01/goodharts_law_and_social_web_design.html"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">opaque</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Just keeping the algorithm private  is not enough as search-engine </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">optimisers</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> soon figure out the key features of the algorithm by experimenting with  what works and what does not, which means that </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Google</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> needs to continuously modify the algorithm to stay  one step ahead of the arbitrageurs. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Maintaining a  continuously updated, opaque algorithm is not a suitable strategy for ratings  agencies. Even if a banker does not know the exact ratings methodology,  he can easily figure out the key features just by running a large  number of sample portfolios through the ratings system and  analysing the results. Moreover, ratings methodologies that are unpredictable  by design can create unnecessary ratings volatility and friction in  financial markets</span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. And last but not least, ratings agencies have no incentive to  engage in such an arms race with the banks given that they get paid by  the bank only when a deal gets done. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The role of ratings agencies in  exacerbating the financial crisis has been exaggerated. As David </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Merkel</span></span> <a href="http://alephblog.com/2010/04/23/in-defense-of-the-rating-agencies-%E2%80%93-v-summary-and-hopefully-final/"><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="color: #0034b0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">puts it</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, </span></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Donâ€™t blame the rating agencies for the failure  of the regulators, because they ceded their statutory role to the rating  agencies." </span></em></span><span style="font-family: minion pro;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The mad rush to buy AAA bonds in the boom wasn't as much a function of the irrational faith in ratings agencies as it was a function of the rational desire to obtain extra  yield whilst not falling foul of internal and external rules and regulations.  Even internal control functions in firms often limit the scope of investments by specifying minimum required ratings and  then assume that this requirement makes all further supervision of the manager redundant. Unsurprisingly, the manager prefers even an expensive AAA to a  cheap BBB bond.</span></span></p>
